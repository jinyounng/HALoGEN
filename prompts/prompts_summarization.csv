"For the first time in eight years, a TV legend returned to doing what he does best. Contestants told to ""come on down!"" on the April 1 edition of ""The Price Is Right"" encountered not host Drew Carey but another familiar face in charge of the proceedings. Instead, there was Bob Barker, who hosted the TV game show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007. Looking spry at 91, Barker handled the first price-guessing game of the show, the classic ""Lucky Seven,"" before turning hosting duties over to Carey, who finished up. Despite being away from the show for most of the past eight years, Barker didn't seem to miss a beat.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'For the first time in eight years, a TV legend returned to doing what he does best.

"Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday. One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote. The others have already gone home. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. As of Monday, that health care worker is in fair condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has said the last of 17 patients who were being monitored are expected to be released by Thursday. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday.

"Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday. Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora ""will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like ... and will be advised to return to their respective places."" Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip. It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday. Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be ""no ordinary typhoon."" Dry told PNA, ""We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall.""","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides as tropical storm Maysak approached the Asian island nation Saturday.

"If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Sure, he can shred it on ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and ""Dr. Feelgood,"" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it ""disgraceful."" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.

"When singer Avril Lavigne went missing from the music scene, there was tons of speculation. Was she pregnant? In rehab? Going through a split from her husband, Nickelback front man Chad Kroeger? Focus on the mystery intensified in December after a fan Twitter account posted a direct message from Lavigne when she solicited prayers, saying she was ""having some health issues."" Now the Canadian singer has revealed to People magazine that she was bedridden for five months after contracting Lyme disease. ""I felt like I couldn't breathe, I couldn't talk, and I couldn't move,"" she told the magazine. ""I thought I was dying."" Lyme disease: What you should know. Lavigne believes that she was bitten by a tick last spring. What followed was months of lightheadedness and lethargy that doctors were initially unable to diagnose. The 30-year-old performer said she recuperated in her Ontario home, where her husband would use tour breaks to care for her and her mother moved in to assist. ""There were definitely times I couldn't shower for a full week because I could barely stand,"" she told People. ""It felt like having all your life sucked out of you."" Opinion: Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease. After her direct message about her health went viral, Lavigne was inundated with concern from fans. ""The get-well messages and videos they sent touched me so deeply,"" she said. Now declaring herself ""80 percent better,"" Lavigne is releasing a new single this month to support the 2015 Special Olympics and says that being ill was a ""wake-up call"" that has given her a new perspective.

"A high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you're in Antarctica. The chilly continent recorded the temperature (15.5 degrees Celsius) on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on Antarctica, according to the Weather Underground. The temperature was recorded at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctica Peninsula, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. (Note to map lovers: The Argentine base is not geographically part of the South American continent.) The World Meteorological Organization, a specialized United Nations agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said Randy Cerveny, the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and Arizona State University professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations, Cerveny said. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to Cerveny, who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall. Researchers who study climate change carefully watch weather changes in the Antarctic region and elsewhere for evidence that the Earth is getting warmer.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you're in Antarctica.

The offbeat TV series, created by Lynch and Mark Frost, featured a quirky FBI agent who went to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the mysterious murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The groundbreaking series is considered one of the most influential shows in television history. Lynch broke the news about his departure in a series of tweets, saying that the show's third season will continue without him. He said he felt the network was not offering enough money to produce the show ""the way it needed to be done."" Lynch also wrote that he had personally called the actors over the weekend to let them know he would no longer be directing. Showtime Network, which will air the nine-episode comeback, released a statement saying they were ""saddened"" by Lynch's decision.

"Hong Kong (CNN)Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media. The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Hong Kong (CNN)Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media.

"One hundred and forty-seven victims. Many more families affected. Even more broken hopes and dreams. As Kenyans mourned those killed last week in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the nation, citizens used social media to share the victims' stories, hopes and dreams. Using the hashtag #147notjustanumber -- a reference to the number of people, mostly students, killed at Garissa University College on Thursday -- Kenyans tweeted pictures of the victims in happier times. Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre. The gunmen who attacked the university in the predawn hours separated Muslims from Christians and killed the latter. The extremist group has also killed Muslims in recent attacks. The Interior Ministry has identified one of the attackers killed by security forces as the son of a government official. The father of suspect Abdirahim Abdullahi is a chief in Mandera and had reported his son missing, officials said. The Islamist extremist group is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the nation that shares a border with Kenya. In 2013, militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall, killing nearly 70 people.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'One hundred and forty-seven victims.

"Tornado sirens blared Wednesday night in Kansas as several storms brought reports of twisters. Spotters reported a tornado about 6 miles northwest of Goddard, which is less than 15 miles west of Wichita.  That storm moved to the northeast, missing the city, but posing potential risks to other communities. ""There will be storms ... that pop up all night long,"" said CNN severe weather expert Chad Myers. ""Nighttime tornadoes are the most deadly, are the most dangerous."" Other reports of tornadoes came in from southwestern Kansas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Three of the sightings were near Aetna, 125 miles southwest of Wichita. Kansas wasn't the only state affected by the storms. The National Weather Service indicated a tornado may have touched down in the small town of Potosi, Missouri, about 70 miles from St. Louis. CNN affiliate KMOV reported that it had received reports of wind damage and flooding in the town. One Instagram user there posted a photo of a fallen tree. Aerial footage also showed damage to roofs and one street overtaken by water. Not far away from Potosi, Shyler and Christin Strube in Leadington posted an Instagram picture of some unusual dark clouds. And a Twitter user in Farmington got bad news when he went out to his car.

"Anyone who has given birth -- or been an observer of the event -- knows how arduous it can be. But to do it live on the Internet? With two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor? Luckily, Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ. In an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet, Katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby (about 6 feet tall) early Friday evening. There was no immediate word on the newborn's gender or condition. But there were good signs, as seen on the live stream and Dallas Zoo's Twitter feed -- like its ears moving, its efforts to stand, and its nursing (or at least trying to nurse) from mom. ""We're so proud,"" the zoo tweeted. The newcomer's debut was a long time coming, especially when you count for Katie's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe, according to Animal Planet. The baby joins a sister, 4-year-old calf Jamie. It wasn't immediately known how many people online saw Katie go into labor and give birth. But the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn, one of them being Katie's BFF Jade. The fact that the spunky Katie held up so well under the spotlight isn't a total shocker.  The zoo describes her as the ""diva"" among a herd of 12 giraffes at the zoo who loves to ""toss her head around"" when she doesn't like something.

"Washington (CNN)Washington was rocked late Thursday by shootings -- one at the gates of the U.S. Census Bureau's headquarters and another in a popular area packed with restaurant patrons. The shootings were connected, authorities said. They began with what authorities believe was a domestic kidnapping incident, according to D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier. The suspect's vehicle was spotted outside the Census Bureau, which is in Suitland, Maryland. A guard apparently approached the vehicle and saw two people arguing. That guard was then shot at least once in the upper body, said Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady. The guard was in extremely critical condition, according to Brady. The police chief said the suspect then fled the scene. Officers picked up the chase, and the suspect fired gunshots at multiple locations, Lanier said. The chase ended in a crash on Washington's busy H Street. A shootout ensues, Lanier said. An officer and the suspect were wounded, according to the police chief. Both were conscious and talking when they left the scene. ""Right now, we have every reason to believe that the car that we have in this last incident here is the same car involved and the same person involved in the kidnapping,"" she said. Lanier told reporters the kidnapping victim was located and is in good condition. She did not identify the suspect, nor the guard, nor the officer who were injured.

"Hip-hop star Nelly has been arrested on drug charges in Tennessee after a state trooper pulled over the private bus in which he was traveling, authorities said. The 40-year-old rapper from St. Louis, who shot to fame 15 years ago with the track ""Country Grammar,"" has been charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security said. The state trooper stopped the bus carrying Nelly and five other people on Interstate 40 in Putnam County on Saturday because it wasn't displaying U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers, according to Tennessee authorities. The trooper was about to conduct an inspection of the bus, a Prevost motor coach, when he ""noticed an odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle,"" authorities said in a statement. Two troopers then searched the bus, finding ""five colored crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine, as well as a small amount of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia,"" the statement said. The search also turned up several handguns and 100 small Ziploc bags, which the statement said are commonly used for selling drugs. The guns included a gold-plated .50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol, a .45-caliber Taurus pistol and a .500 Smith & Wesson magnum.

"New Delhi  (CNN)An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed India's biggest corporate scandal in memory, police said. Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of software services exporter Satyam Computers Services, was also fined $804,000, R.K. Gaur, a spokesman for India's Central Bureau of Investigation, told CNN. In 2009, Satyam Computers Services was at the center of a massive $1.6 billion fraud case after its then-chairman Raju admitted inflating profits with fictitious assets and nonexistent cash. Investigators say losses to investors resulting from the company's book manipulation were much higher. A special court convicted Raju and nine other people of cheating, criminal conspiracy, breach of public trust and other charges, said the Central Bureau of Investigation, which looked into the case. In the media, the case has been compared to the 2001 Enron Corp. scandal, in which a Houston energy company's earnings had been overstated by several hundred million dollars. When the scam made headlines, Satyam, which means ""truth"" in Sanskrit, was India's fourth-largest software services provider. It was serving almost 700 companies, including 185 Fortune 500 companies, and generated more than half of its revenue from the United States. The company had about 53,000 employees and operated in 65 countries. After Raju's shock disclosures six years ago, the Indian government fired Satyam's board. In a subsequent state-backed auction, the company was bought by Tech Mahindra, part of the country's Mahindra Group. A heavyweight of the nation's software industry, Raju, 60, has been in jail for the past 32 months. He had founded Satyam in 1987. His company made giant strides as the outsourcing business grew in India in the 1990s.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'New Delhi  (CNN)An Indian software pioneer and nine others have been sentenced to seven years in jail for their role in what has been dubbed India's biggest corporate scandal in memory, police said.

Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson Jr. ruled that Hicks' case is ""death penalty qualified,"" WRAL and WTVD reported. The 46-year-old was arrested February 10 in the deaths of Yusor Mohammad, 21, her 23-year-old husband, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha.

"The University of Michigan has decided to proceed with a screening of the film ""American Sniper"" despite objections from some students. More than 200 students signed a petition asking the school not to show the movie as part of UMix, a series of social events the university stages for students. Bradley Cooper was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Chris Kyle, a Navy SEAL and the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. Kyle was fatally shot at a Texas shooting range in 2013. Some students believed the movie's depiction of the Iraq War reflected negatively on the Middle East and people from that region. Michigan's Detroit metropolitan area is home to the nation's largest Arab-American population. But there was a backlash to the decision to yank the movie, and a counter-petition asked school officials to reconsider. On Wednesday, E. Royster Harper, University of Michigan's vice president for student life, said in a statement that ""It was a mistake to cancel the showing of the movie 'American Sniper' on campus as part of a social event for students"" and that the show will go on.

The Middlesex District Attorney's Office said that Carlos Colina, 32, will be arraigned the morning of April 14 for murder in connection with the remains discovered Saturday in Cambridge. Earlier this week, Colina was arraigned on charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A Middlesex County judge then revoked bail for Colina in another case he's involved in, for alleged assault and battery. The victim in that case is different from the one whose remains were found in recent days. Police were notified Saturday morning about a suspicious item along a walkway in Cambridge. Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains.

"A judge this week sentenced a former TSA agent to six months in jail for secretly videotaping a female co-worker while she was in the bathroom, prosecutors said. During the investigation, detectives with the Metro Nashville Police Department in Tennessee also found that the agent, 33-year-old Daniel Boykin, entered the woman's home multiple times, where he took videos, photos and other data. Police found more than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim on Boykin's phone and computer. The victim filed a complaint after seeing images of herself on his phone last year. Boykin plead guilty to unlawful photography, aggravated burglary and violation of the computer act, the Nashville District Attorney's Office said. Police said the incident happened in a TSA-only restroom, and that there was no evidence public restrooms were targeted.

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN)ISIS claimed it controlled part of Iraq's largest oil refinery Sunday, posting images online that purported to show the storming of the facility, fierce clashes and plumes of smoke rising above the contested site. The group said it launched an assault on the Baiji oil refinery late Saturday. By Sunday, ISIS said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings, but Iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted Iraqi forces remain in full control. CNN couldn't independently verify ISIS' claim. It wouldn't be the first time that militants and Iraqi forces have battled over the refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. If an attack damaged oil fields or machinery, it could have a significant impact.

"Two Alabama college students are accused of gang raping a woman while on spring break at Florida's Panama City Beach. Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee, students at Troy University, were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, according to a statement from the Bay County, Florida, Sheriff's Office. The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found video of what appeared to be a Panama City gang rape during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting. The video was turned over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The Bay County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigations Division has identified the victim in the video but said state law prevents the office from releasing any information about her. She was a visitor in Panama City. ""We are not releasing her location or any additional information on victim to protect her from further trauma,"" said sheriff's spokesman Tommy Ford. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place sometime from March 10, 2015, to March 12, 2015, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. A statement from Troy University confirmed the two men are current students. ""The students have been placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures.

"After a Russian fighter jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an ""unsafe and unprofessional manner"" earlier this week, the United States is complaining to Moscow about the incident. On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were ""unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,"" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will ""file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels"" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it ""one of the most dangerous close passes in decades."" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska.

The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were ""unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,"" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will ""file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels"" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it ""one of the most dangerous close passes in decades."" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska.

"Over the last year more than 25,000 people, a population about the size of Key West, Florida, have fought Ebola infections. More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the ""most severe public health emergency seen in modern times"" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials.

"Desperate migrants from Africa and the Middle East keep heading to Europe, with 978 rescued Friday in the Mediterranean Sea, the Italian Coast Guard said Saturday via Twitter. The migrants were picked up 30 miles off the coast of Libya, said European Parliament member Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's far-right Northern League. In the first three months of 2015, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving, the International Organization for Migration said, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IMO said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IMO said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves. At this time last year, there were fewer than 50 deaths reported, the IMO said. Most of the migrants are asylum seekers, victims of trafficking or violence, unaccompanied children and pregnant women.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Desperate migrants from Africa and the Middle East keep heading to Europe, with 978 rescued Friday in the Mediterranean Sea, the Italian Coast Guard said Saturday via Twitter.

"Malala Yousafzai's stellar career has included a Nobel Peace Prize. Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. ""My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),"" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. ""It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner."" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical.

"Jodi Arias was sentenced to life in prison Monday for the gruesome 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander. Maricopa County Judge Sherry Stephens could have sentenced Arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years, but decided the convicted killer should spend the rest of her life behind bars. Before her sentence was handed down, Arias expressed remorse for her actions. ""To this day I can't believe that I was capable of doing something that terrible,"" Arias said. ""I'm truly disgusted and repulsed with myself. I'm horrified because of what I did, and I wish there was some way I could take it back."" Earlier, Travis Alexander's sisters gave their victim impact statements. Hillary Alexander said she's trying to block her brother from her life. ""I don't want to remember him anymore, because it hurts too much to remember him alive. ... I remember how he was brutally taken from us and I can't handle it. This is what I've had to do so I can cope,"" she said through tears. Arias, 34, was found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2013. The jury that convicted her found the murder was especially cruel, making Arias eligible for the death penalty. However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Because a second jury was deadlocked in the penalty phase of Arias' case, the death penalty was taken off the table, leaving Arias' sentence up to the judge. Arias will serve her sentence at the Lumley Unit in the Arizona State Prison Complex-Perryville near Goodyear, Arizona.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Jodi Arias was sentenced to life in prison Monday for the gruesome 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander.

As the season unfolds, he heads toward a confrontation with Vincent D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. the Kingpin. Two love interests enter Murdock's life in the form of Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll) and Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson). Oh, and there's that red suit. So what do critics think?

Students on the Kikuyu campus stampeded down the halls of the Kimberly dormitory, and some jumped from its fifth floor, the university said. Hundreds were injured and were taken to hospitals.

"Tokyo (CNN)The operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant has given up trying to recover a robotic probe after it stopped moving inside one of the reactors. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the remote-controlled robot on Friday inside one of the damaged reactors that had suffered a meltdown following a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011. It was the first time the probe had been used. The robot, set out to collect data on radiation levels and investigate the spread of debris, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO. A newly released report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device Sunday as it had already covered two-thirds of the originally planned route. It managed to collect data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an ""unprecedented"" experiment.

Tourists and locals line up around the block for several hours just to get their hands on Jenny's cookies -- at $9 a tin. Its popularity has spurred bakeries to make and sell knockoffs, and the original store has signs warning against buying 'fake' Jenny's cookies.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Hundreds of additional Iraqi troops are being sent to reinforce colleagues who are trying to fend off ISIS' attempt to overrun Iraq's largest oil refinery, a key paramilitary force said Tuesday. The reinforcements come four days after ISIS began attacking northern Iraq's Baiji oil refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. The additional troops came from Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near the city of Tikrit, according to the media office of the Hasd Al-Shaabi militia. The reinforcements include two federal police regiments, an Iraqi military quick reaction force battalion and a regiment from Hasd Al-Shaabi, which is a predominantly Shia militia that worked with the Iraqi military as well as Sunni fighters to liberate Tikrit from ISIS about two weeks ago. ISIS launched an assault on the Baiji oil refinery late Saturday. By Sunday, ISIS said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings, but Iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted that Iraqi forces remained in full control. The Hasd Al-Shaabi media office said Tuesday that Iraqi troops already at the refinery were holding their ground, preparing to push ISIS out of the facility entirely. The attack could have a significant effect if it damages oil fields or machinery. The refinery is 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Tikrit. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Arwa Damon and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Hundreds of additional Iraqi troops are being sent to reinforce colleagues who are trying to fend off ISIS' attempt to overrun Iraq's largest oil refinery, a key paramilitary force said Tuesday.

"More than 500 Houthi rebels have been killed since the start of Saudi-led military operations against Yemeni Shia fighters, a Saudi Defense Ministry official said Saturday, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. A Saudi general said Saturday the nine-nation coalition has undertaken 1,200 airstrikes since they began on March 26. Gen. Ahmed Asiri added that the raids aim to keep the rebels from moving toward southern Yemen,  according to the SPA. Clashes took place Friday near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in the Najran region. Saudi forces responded to mortar rounds fired by Houthis on a Saudi border site. Three Saudi military officers were killed and two others were wounded in the shelling, a defense official said, according to SPA. A Saudi source also confirmed to CNN's Nic Robertson that three Saudi soldiers were killed in the shelling. The Yemeni Health Ministry on Saturday said 385 civilians have been killed and 342 others have been wounded. The World Health Organization has put higher figure on both tolls -- 648 killed and 2,191 wounded -- but includes militant casualties in the totals. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January.

"Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress turned lifestyle guru, is known for promoting detoxes and health cleanses on her site, Goop.com. But she's now bringing awareness to the difficulties of life on food stamps. In a tweet Friday, Paltrow showcased an array of leafy greens, dried beans and rice, purchased for the amount a person living on food stamps is allotted each week, she explained. The amount of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits a person can get is based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan. The plan estimates how much it costs to buy food, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In this case, Paltrow will be spending just under $30 for groceries. Her participation is part of the #FoodBankNYCChallenge. Celebrity chef Mario Batali, a close friend of the star's, nominated Paltrow and musicians Sting and Deborah Harry for the challenge through a video. The challenge urges participants to use only $29 for all the food a person eats for seven days. ""For one week, walk in someone else's shoes,"" Batali is quoted saying on the Food Bank for New York City's website. ""By truly understanding what our friends and neighbors are going through, we will be better equipped to find solutions."" The #FoodBankNYCChallenge is an attempt to live on a food stamp budget for one week, which translates to $1.38 per meal, according to the site. The effort is in response to recent cuts to food stamps. ""Congress cut food stamps twice since 2013, and soup kitchens and food pantries saw an immediate increase in visitors,"" the site explains. Organizers hope the challenge will raise public awareness of the struggles for families to afford food while on food stamps.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress turned lifestyle guru, is known for promoting detoxes and health cleanses on her site, Goop.com.

I didn't know if anyone was hurt."" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. ""Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,"" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off.

"Cairo (CNN)At least 12 people were killed Sunday, and more injured, in separate attacks on a police station, a checkpoint and along a highway in Egypt's northern Sinai, authorities said. Six people, including one civilian, were killed when a car bomb exploded near the police station in Al-Arish, capital of North Sinai, Health Ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghafar told Ahram Online. He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed. In that earlier attack, a first lieutenant, a sergeant and four conscripts were killed when their armored vehicle was attacked on the highway from Al-Arish to Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, the military said. Two other soldiers were injured and taken to a military hospital. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed many attacks against the army and police in Sinai. A third attack Sunday on a checkpoint in Rafah left three security personnel injured, after unknown assailants opened fire at them, according to state media. The attacks come as the military announced a reshuffle of several senior military positions, state media reported. Among those being replaced are the generals in charge of military intelligence and Egypt's second field army, which is spearheading the battle against the insurgents in the northern Sinai. Egypt's army has been fighting a decade-long militant Islamist insurgency, which has spiked since the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsy in the summer of 2013.

"Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children can lose up to $11,000 of welfare benefits a year under a new government policy, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced. Currently parents can choose to opt out of vaccinations for medical or religious reasons, or by stating they are ""conscientious objectors,"" and still receive taxpayer funded child care benefits. Under the new ""no jab, no pay"" policy, the exemption as a conscientious objector will be removed starting January 2016. ""The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,"" said Abbott in a joint statement with Social Services Minister, Scott Morrison. Thousands of families could lose out on welfare payments, with the Australian government estimating more than 39,000 children under the age of seven have not been vaccinated because of their parents' objections. The number of children in Australia who have not received immunization against measles and other diseases has almost doubled in the past decade, according to the government. Anti-vaccination campaigns have recently gained traction in Western countries. Some parents believe the shots cause autism, but the theory has been widely discredited. Existing exemptions on medical or religious grounds will continue said Abbott, but guidelines on religious exemptions will be tightened. ""It requires the formal position of that religious body being advised to the government and approved by the government. This is a very significant narrowing,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. He added that no mainstream religious organizations have made any formal objection to immunizations.

"A measles outbreak that affected more than 130 Californians since December is over, the California Department of Public Health declared Friday. It has been 42 days since the last known case of B3 strain of measles, the equivalent of two successive incubation periods, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the health department. The department said in its latest update that 131 people came down with the B3 strain, and five who had a different genotype than the outbreak strain. Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated. ""Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak,"" Smith said. The outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. It  is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.

The outbreak began with dozens of visitors to two Disney theme parks in the state. The health department said 42 of the cases occurred from December 17-20. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. It  is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.'

"A natural gas line explosion at a law enforcement shooting range in Fresno, California, injured 11 people, including some inmates who were on a work detail there. Others being treated include a county road worker and two sheriff's deputies, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said. The exact cause of Friday's blast is under investigation, Mims said, but it happened at the spot where a county worker was operating a front loader. The explosion sparked a fire that roared like a jet engine, Mims said. The operator of the front loader was injured but able to walk to an ambulance, the sheriff said. The most serious injuries were suffered by a group of inmates who were assigned to maintenance and cleaning work at the sheriff's firing range. There were 10 inmates near the blast site who were also injured, officials said. Three other inmates at the site were not hurt. Earlier, the sheriff's office included them in the injury count. After the blast, Mims said, two sheriff's deputies who were at the firing range ran toward the fire to move the injured. CNN affiliate KFSN posted a video of the scene that shows a tall ball of fire rising from near a highway. One inmate was airlifted to the hospital, the sheriff said. That inmate and the county worker were undergoing emergency surgery, she said. The others suffered mostly burns. The pair of deputies who provided aid also went for treatment for ringing ears and sunburn-like conditions, she said. Firefighters put out the blaze, revealing a crater at the blast site and a blackened front loader, Mims said.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A natural gas line explosion at a law enforcement shooting range in Fresno, California, injured 11 people, including some inmates who were on a work detail there.

"No identification, no Social Security card and only a box to live on. John Helinski was homeless and nameless for three years. Suddenly, he's set to buy his own place and collect a nice pension. Helinski hit it big thanks to the Social Security Administration, and a big-hearted cop and a case worker determined to untangle major bureaucracy. Charles Inman could not bear to see his 62-year-old ward land back on the street, he told CNN affiliate WFTS. The shelter where the case worker works set Helinski up with a bunk and a locker. But getting him into the system was hard, because Helinski's ID and Social Security cards had been stolen. ""He needed to have an identification, but we couldn't get an identification without a birth certificate,"" Inman said. A hassle all by itself, except that Helinski was foreign born -- in Poland, as an American citizen. ""We first had to figure out that we needed a consular record of foreign birth or something like that,"" said Tampa police Officer Dan McDonald, who pitched in to help Helinski. With those papers squared away, he and Inman got Helinski a driver's license and a Social Security card. Then, Helinski remembered that he used to have an account with a certain Landmark Bank. ""Then it became Bank of America,"" he said. The account was still there, and the Social Security Administration hadn't forgotten about him. It had kept paying Helinski benefits for years, and they had stacked up high. Now Helinski is thinking of buying his own four walls. And he'll have monthly benefits to live on.

"Chinese police have arrested more than 133,000 people and seized 43.3 tons of illegal narcotics during a six-month anti-drug campaign, the country's Ministry of Public Security has announced. Authorities also handled 115,000 drug-related crimes -- such as robbery -- and 606,000 cases of drug use during the nationwide campaign to ""ban drugs in hundreds of cities,"" Liu Yuejin, Assistant Minister of Public Security, said Wednesday. The figures were nearly double the same period a year earlier, while the amount of narcotics seized was up by 44.9%, according to the ministry. Liu said drug trafficking groups have ""suffered a heavy blow"" and drug users have been ""forcefully regulated."" However, the police also paid a price, Liu said, in quotes carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Nine police officers died and another 657 were wounded in the mission, with 76 severely wounded. The ministry rewarded 60 units and 100 people. Liu said China's drug-related problems were still severe, with online drug trafficking an increasing problem. He said the ministry had launched a three-month online campaign starting in April targeting people engaged in drug-related Internet crimes. Over the past nine months, a string of movie and television stars, film directors and pop singers have been arrested and charged over drug related incidents, including Jaycee Chan, son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan, who was convicted on a drug charge and sentenced to six months in prison by a Beijing court. In August last year, dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with Beijing authorities banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to sack any artists who broke the law.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Chinese police have arrested more than 133,000 people and seized 43.3 tons of illegal narcotics during a six-month anti-drug campaign, the country's Ministry of Public Security has announced.

"Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. Nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Fallin's office said in a press release. CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States. ""The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death,"" said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same ""painless"" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. ""The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically,"" he said. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett. Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty. ""Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous,"" Fallin said. ""I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard."" The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Oklahoma Gov.

CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States. ""The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death,"" said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same ""painless"" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. ""The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically,"" he said. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett. Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty. ""Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous,"" Fallin said. ""I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard."" The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad.'

"French customs officers say they have seized more than 2 tons of cocaine aboard a sailboat that was falsely flying an American flag in the Caribbean. The drugs, whose value is estimated at more than $105 million, are the biggest cocaine seizure ever carried out by French authorities, said Michael Lachaux, director of customs operations in Martinique. Officers arrested one Venezuelan and two Spanish citizens who were on board the vessel off the coast of Martinique on Wednesday, Lachaux said in an interview with the radio station France Info on Saturday.

"Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces have successfully ousted ISIS from the nation's largest oil refinery, the coalition said Sunday. Iraqi security forces regained full control of the Baiji refinery, the Combined Joint Task Force said. A week ago, ISIS claimed it controlled part of the facility, posting images online that purported to back up the claim. Iraq is working to fortify the facility's defenses, the task force said in a statement. Over the past nine days, the coalition conducted 47 airstrikes in the area, the statement said. Meanwhile, Peshmerga forces -- also with the assistance of coalition strikes -- cleared 84 square kilometers (32 square miles) of ISIS-occupied territory in Iraq on Saturday, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said. The Peshmerga are the national military force of Kurdistan. ""Front-line reporting indicates at least 35 ISIS terrorists were killed during the offensive,"" the council said in a statement. The goal was to push back ISIS and ""diminish its ability to threaten the security of Kirkuk province,"" the statement said.

" An Asiana Airlines plane overran a runway while landing at Japan's Hiroshima Airport on Tuesday evening, prompting the airport to temporarily close, the Japanese transportation ministry said. Twenty-three people had minor injuries after Flight 162 landed at 8:05 p.m., according to fire department and ministry sources. There were 73 passengers and eight crew members -- including five cabin attendants, two pilots and a maintenance official -- aboard when the flight took off from South Korea's Incheon International Airport at 6:34 p.m. local time, Asiana said in a statement late Tuesday. Authorities are investigating initial reports that the Airbus A320 may have hit an object on the runway during landing, causing damage to the rear of its body and the cover of the engine on the left wing, the ministry said. Video of the scene showed the aircraft's body turned around, with its nose pointing in the direction that the plane had come from. Hiroshima Airport closed because of the incident Tuesday night while fire department officials worked at the scene. Airbus, the plane's manufacturer, is aware of the incident and is working to gather more information, Airbus regional media relations manager Marie Caujolle said.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: ' An Asiana Airlines plane overran a runway while landing at Japan's Hiroshima Airport on Tuesday evening, prompting the airport to temporarily close, the Japanese transportation ministry said.

The movie, due out August 7, promises a very different take on the classic Marvel comics characters, played this go-round by Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell. We also get our first glimpse of the villainous Dr. Doom in this new trailer, released Sunday. Fans on Twitter had mixed reactions. Check out the trailer here:.

After a genetically modified mutant dinosaur escapes from an island theme park along with others, he takes charge of a mission to contain the dangerous creatures. (The trailer also includes part of a scene that caused controversy after Joss Whedon called it ""sexist"" last week.)

"A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday.

"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers. His feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others. And observers were quick to point out that Abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in Australia. Abbott was in a Sydney pub on Saturday evening when a group of Australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them. The Prime Minister accepted and even gave a short, impromptu speech, one of the football coaches, Simon Carrodus, told The Australian Woman's Weekly. ""Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head. And he was proud as punch,"" Carrodus said. A schooner holds about three-quarters of a pint. Video of Abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants ""Skol! Skol!"" drew plenty of attention on social media. Some commentators focused on Abbott's drinking technique. But others suggested he was setting a bad example. Abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year. ""Like most Australians, I enjoy a drink on social occasions,"" he said in January 2014. ""However, as a father and as a citizen, I'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent, especially at ""hot spots"" in our big cities."" Casting those concerns aside, some social media users belittled Abbott's beer swilling. They said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers.

"Suspected Boko Haram militants this week attacked civilians inside Cameroon for the first time in a month, killing at least 16 villagers, a military spokesman told CNN Saturday. Six attackers were killed by Cameroonian forces, said Maj. Nlate Eballe, an operations officer with a special military unit set up to fight Boko Haram. The attackers came Thursday ""in the hundreds ... torched Dia village in the Far North Region,"" he said. Dia is a village that borders Lake Chad and has been identified as a recruiting ground for Boko Haram. Regional Gov. Mijiyawa Bakary said the insurgents have been attacking border villages in Cameroon in search of supplies. Cameroonian troops retook cattle that was stolen by the attackers in Dia, Eballe said. The last attack in Cameroon by the Nigeria-based militants was March 10, when the assailants struck the locality of Kerawa-Mafa in a failed attempt to overrun a military base. Boko Haram, whose name translates as ""Western education is sin,"" has been waging a years-long campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law in Nigeria. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria, but neighboring countries -- Cameroon included -- have also been hit increasingly hard.

"It seems iPads hold their value pretty well, especially if they have papal connections. One that Pope Francis once owned just sold for $30,500, according to Castells, an auction house in Uruguay. The Apple tablet had all the personal touches. ""His Holiness Francisco"" and ""Vatican Internet Service, March 2013"" were engraved on the back in Spanish and Italian. It also came with a keyboard and a certificate signed by the Pope's personal secretary. The proceeds will go to a school in Montevideo, Uruguay. It's not the first time a papal hand-me-down has gone for big bucks. Last year, the Pope donated a Harley-Davidson that he was given to charity. The motorcycle sold for $284,000 at auction, more than 10 times its normal sales price. A Harley motorcycle jacket signed by Francis sold for nearly $68,000.

"At least 21 people were killed during a shipwreck off the northern coast of Haiti, the country's civil protection directorate told CNN on Thursday. A small boat carrying about 50 migrants left from the area of Le Borgne, west of Cap-Haitien, on Wednesday night. It began to sail toward the island of Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos when it was caught in bad weather, civil protection spokesman Joseph Edgar Celestin said. The vessel hit a reef and sank as it tried to return to shore near Le Borgne. Rescuers, most of them volunteers from the town of Le Borgne and surrounding communities, were dispatched to the scene  and rescued at least 12 people, Celestin said. The search for survivors is ongoing, Celestin added. So far, 11 victims -- eight men and three women -- have been identified, Celestin said.

"Hong Kong (CNN)Phil Rudd, the drummer for legendary hard rock band AC/DC, has pleaded guilty to charges of threatening to kill and possession of drugs in a New Zealand court. Rudd, who previously denied all allegations, made a surprise guilty plea Tuesday before the trial began. The 60-year-old Australian was arrested in November last year after police found methamphetamine and cannabis while executing a search warrant at his home in New Zealand. According to a court summary, Rudd fired several employees because the release of his solo album in August had flopped in the charts. A month later, he called an associate and said he wanted his personal assistant ""taken out."" He later then called the victim -- his personal assistant -- on the phone and said, ""I'm going to come over and kill you."" Rudd made several calls to his personal assistant over the following days, but he terminated the calls after realizing it was Rudd on the phone. ""As a result of the threats made by the defendant, the victim was genuinely very fearful of his safety,"" read the summary. The drummer's lawyer, Craig Tuck, told reporters outside the court that the charges were ""essentially just an angry phone call."" ""I will be seeking to have him discharged without conviction,"" Tuck added in an email to CNN. Rudd could face up to seven years in prison for the charge of threatening to kill. He is currently released on bail until the sentencing hearing on June 26. In November, the court dropped the police charge of ""attempting to procure murder"" after prosecutors decided there wasn't enough evidence.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Hong Kong (CNN)Phil Rudd, the drummer for legendary hard rock band AC/DC, has pleaded guilty to charges of threatening to kill and possession of drugs in a New Zealand court.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Al Qaeda fighters attacked a prison in the coastal Yemeni city of Al Mukallah early Thursday, freeing at least 270 prisoners, a third of whom have al Qaeda links, a senior Defense Ministry official has told CNN. Khaled Batarfi, a senior al Qaeda figure, was among the escapees, officials said. Dozens of attackers took control of government buildings, including the city's Central Prison, Central Bank and radio station during the assault early Thursday, according to officials. Government troops arrived early Thursday and clashed with the al Qaeda fighters, and most of the militants fled, the officials said. Last month, hundreds of inmates escaped from Al Mansoorah Central Prison in Aden after clashes between Shiite Houthi rebels and forces loyal to ousted Sunni President  Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Shiite Houthi rebels removed Hadi, a Sunni, from power. The sectarian nature of the conflict is drawing in regional rivals Saudi Arabia, which is predominately Sunni -- and is the country to which Hadi ultimately fled -- and Iran, which is predominately Shiite and supports the Houthi rebels. Because of that, the conflict in Yemen risks becoming a proxy war in the struggle between the Iranians and the Saudis for preeminence in the Middle East. The Saudis have conducted airstrikes against the Houthi rebels and could send in ground troops. But little is simple in the Middle East. And while the conflict between the Houthis and forces loyal to Hadi rages in the western part of the country, where it has caused hundreds of civilian deaths, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, controls parts of eastern Yemen. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Al Qaeda fighters attacked a prison in the coastal Yemeni city of Al Mukallah early Thursday, freeing at least 270 prisoners, a third of whom have al Qaeda links, a senior Defense Ministry official has told CNN.

The passenger received medical attention before being released, according to Marissa Snow, spokeswoman for SkyWest. She said the airliner expects to accommodate the 75 passengers on another aircraft to their original destination -- Hartford, Connecticut -- later Wednesday afternoon. The Federal Aviation Administration initially reported a pressurization problem and said it would investigate.

"Cigarettes have been put out across the bars of New Orleans. Cigars are welcome no more. The city known for excess of everything -- drinking, eating, dancing in the street until all hours -- went smoke-free as Tuesday became Wednesday at midnight. How can that be? It turns out that the city known for its over-the-top Mardi Gras celebrations and incredible jazz fests (starting Friday!) didn't want its waiters and musicians to have to breathe smoke to do their jobs anymore. The New Orleans City Council passed its ban against smoking in most places across the city -- including bars, casinos and restaurants -- in January, and the vote was unanimous, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports. Bar owners worried about potential revenue loss, while puffing customers bemoaned the loss of their smoking spots.

"A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for ""Barbara,"" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the ""warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions."" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited ""three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,"" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. ""For her to go to Mexico,"" Mate said, ""It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from."" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to ""navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,"" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Brazilian police have arrested the treasurer of the ruling Workers' Party, bringing the bribery investigation at the state-run oil company Petrobras a step closer to President Dilma Rousseff. Federal police arrested Joao Vaccari Neto at his home in Sao Paulo on Wednesday morning. Vaccari faces charges of corruption and money laundering as part of the broader probe into corruption at Petrobras. Former executives who have turned state's evidence claim that construction companies paid large sums under the table to Petrobras officials and politicians in order to secure lucrative contracts with the oil giant. Vaccari has denied any wrongdoing and recently told a congressional commission that all donations to his party were legal and were reviewed by electoral authorities. Vaccari is the closest political figure to Rousseff so far implicated in the investigation. Rousseff herself has not been implicated, although she was the chairwoman of Petrobras when much of the alleged corruption took place. Rousseff has insisted she supports the probe and has not in any way interfered with the investigation. Sources quoted in Brazilian media have said investigators are looking at whether some of the bribes went toward Rousseff's election campaigns. Anger over what has ballooned into a multi-million dollar corruption scandal has eroded Rousseff's approval rating and prompted hundreds of thousands of Brazilians to take to the streets in protest. On Sunday, about half a million people participated in demonstrations across the country. But turnout was smaller than a month earlier, when roughly one million people marched in protest, raising questions about how long the demonstrations can last.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Brazilian police have arrested the treasurer of the ruling Workers' Party, bringing the bribery investigation at the state-run oil company Petrobras a step closer to President Dilma Rousseff.

"Chile's Calbuco volcano erupted twice in 24 hours, the country's National Geology and Mining Service said early Thursday. The agency said it was evaluating the spectacular nighttime eruption, but indicated it was ""stronger than the first one."" About 23½ inches (60 centimeters) of ash fell in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. Authorities issued a red alert for the towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in southern Chile. Both are popular tourist destinations. A 12-mile (20 kilometer) exclusion zone was established around the crater. Military and police forces were assisting with the evacuations of more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. ""At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew and later there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,"" said one Puerto Montt resident. Another person said: ""It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs."" The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was 1962.  There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996. Alejandro Verges, regional director at the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety, said Thursday afternoon that officials are concerned there might be a third eruption.

"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence issued an executive order Monday to extend a public health emergency in his state in response to a rampant HIV outbreak that first began in mid-December. As of Tuesday, there were 135 cases -- 129 confirmed, and six preliminary --  of HIV. The increase has been linked to injection drug use, primarily of the prescription opioid opana. Pence issued an order in March for Scott County, which then had 79 confirmed cases of HIV since mid-December. The county normally averages about five new cases a year. ""Scott County is facing an epidemic of HIV. But this is not a Scott County problem -- this is an Indiana problem,"" Pence said in March. Officials expect more cases as more individuals are tested, particularly because it can take up to three months for HIV to appear in a person's system after initial infection. The emergency order was first issued last month and set to expire Friday, but now will be in place until May 24. It calls on multiple state agencies to coordinate a response to the unprecedented outbreak and provides additional resources. Law enforcement, emergency agencies and health officials are working together. Most notably, a temporary needle exchange program that began April 4.

"Ahmed Farouq didn't have the prestige of fellow al Qaeda figure Osama bin Laden, the influence of Anwar al-Awlaki, or the notoriety of Adam Gadahn. Still, he was a big deal. That's the assessment of multiple sources on a man who may not have been well-known in the West, but nonetheless had a special role in the terrorist group. Farouq -- an American -- died in a U.S. counterterrorism airstrike in January, according to the White House. Two al Qaeda hostages, Warren Weinstein of the United States and Giovanni Lo Porto from Italy, were killed in the same strike, while Gadahn died in another U.S. operation that month. Before that, Farouq was the deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, or AQIS, a branch of the Islamist extremist group that formed in recent years. The branch made its presence known in September 2014, when militants infiltrated Pakistan's navy and tried to hijack one of its ships, according to the SITE Institute, which monitors terror groups.

"This time, it's official: Russia expects North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to visit Moscow next month for World War II anniversary celebrations. North Korean representatives have confirmed that Kim will be in the Russian capital for May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said Wednesday, according to Russian state-run news agency Tass. This would mark Kim's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of North Korea in late 2011. Kim will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the May visit, Tass reported.

"The FBI is investigating a possible ISIS-inspired terrorist threat in the United States, law enforcement officials said Saturday. The investigation originated from intercepted chatter and other intelligence information that led officials to believe a possible plot could be in the works, the officials said. No arrests have been made. It's not clear whether the threat is real or aspirational. The exact nature of the threat couldn't be learned. One official said it focused on parts of California where officials stepped up security, a U.S. official said. The Transportation Security Administration alerted local law enforcement agencies that are responsible for external security around airports, but officials said the possible threat is not necessarily aviation-related. Some cities around the United States have increased their security as a precaution. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson declined Saturday to talk about specifics, but spoke about security measures in general. ""Over the last few months, we have made a number of security adjustments, including enhanced screening at select overseas airports and increasing random searches of passengers and carry-on luggage on flights inbound to the U.S., reflecting an evolving threat picture,"" the spokesman said. He said the DHS added layers of security to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization. ETSA is an online application system to screen travelers before they are allow to board an airplane or ship bound for the United States.

"Tobacco companies including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds filed suit this week against the Food and Drug Administration alleging that the FDA is violating the companies' free speech rights. In March, the FDA issued guidance that if significant changes are made to a product's label, like color or a logo, the product requires new approval from the administration. This holds true even if the product was previously approved. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, argues that those guidelines go too far and are too vague. They violate the First Amendment because they pre-emptively restrict free speech and exceed the scope of the Tobacco Control Act, the companies claim. The FDA's actions, the suit says, do not advance a substantial government interest. The plaintiffs also include U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co., American Snuff Co., Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co. and Lorillard Tobacco Co.

"Seoul (CNN)South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo offered to resign on Monday amid a growing political scandal.

He has transferred his role of chairing Cabinet meetings to the deputy prime minister for the time being, according to his office. Park heard about the resignation and called it ""regrettable,"" according to the South Korean presidential office. Calls for Lee to resign began after South Korean tycoon Sung Woan-jong was found hanging from a tree in Seoul in an apparent suicide on April 9. Sung, who was under investigation for fraud and bribery, left a note listing names and amounts of cash given to top officials, including those who work for the President. Lee and seven other politicians with links to the South Korean President are under investigation. A special prosecutor's team has been established to investigate the case. Lee had adamantly denied the allegations as the scandal escalated: ""If there are any evidence, I will give out my life. As a Prime Minister, I will accept Prosecutor Office's investigation first."" Park has said that she is taking the accusations very seriously. Before departing on her trip to Central and South America, she condemned political corruption in her country.

"A photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the Nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country. His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble. The baby was taken to Bhaktapur Hospital and found to be uninjured;. His unlikely rescue provides some hope to a country that has experienced so much loss.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the Nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country.

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)Ten people have been sentenced to life in prison for their roles in the 2012 attack on Nobel Peace Prize-winning activist Malala Yousafzai, a judge announced Thursday. The assailant's conviction and sentences follow a trial that included testimony from both sides, according to Pakistani antiterrorism judge Mohammad Amin Kundi. The 10 were arrested in Swat, a district of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said last September. That was nearly two years after the then 15-year-old Yousafzai -- who was despised by Taliban militants for her outspoken support of girls' right to an education -- was shot as she was traveling home on a school bus. She not only survived that attack, but went on to become an even more vocal international activist.

As police departments around the country see more protests over the use of lethal force, IMPD officials acknowledge that this is a time of ""increased scrutiny of police operations and tactics,"" but said the decision to change the uniform for certain ranks within the department is ""not related to any specific, individual incident occurring elsewhere in the United States.""

"April 27 is celebrated as Freedom Day in South Africa, commemorating the country's first democratic elections in 1994 election which saw Nelson Mandela elected as president. The day is widely seen as marking the start of a free South Africa after the fall of apartheid, a system of racial segregation implemented by the white-minority government in South Africa for decades. This year's celebrations come against the backdrop of a spate of anti-immigrant attacks earlier in April in which a number of people lost their lives.

"A prosecutor has dismissed allegations that Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner tried to cover up Iran's involvement in a 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires. The move by prosecutor Javier de Luca to drop the case could mean a definitive end to the accusations that have roiled the nation, according to Argentina's state-run Telam news agency. The case became of high interest globally after the original prosecutor who brought the allegations was found dead in January. Alberto Nisman was found dead days after making the accusations. His death sparked outrage and conspiracy theories aplenty. Nisman alleged that Argentina's government agreed not to go after Iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal. The 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in the Argentine capital is the deadliest terror attack in the country's history. Eighty-five people were killed, and hundreds were injured. A second prosecutor took the reins after Nisman's death and took the case to court in February. A judge dismissed the case, saying that Nisman's allegations did not hold up. Following that, the case went to prosecutor de Luca for a possible appeal. On Monday, de Luca announced that in his investigation he found that ""there was no crime here, either carried out or attempted,"" according to Telam.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A prosecutor has dismissed allegations that Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner tried to cover up Iran's involvement in a 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires.

The 92-year-old died this week at her home in Simsbury, Connecticut. As a 19-year-old telephone operator, Keefe posed for the famous painting that would become the cover of the Saturday Evening Post on May 29, 1943. Although she was petite, Keefe was transformed into the iconic -- and burly -- embodiment of the character by Rockwell. ""Other than the red hair and my face, Norman Rockwell embellished Rosie's body,"" Keefe said in a 2012 interview with the Hartford Courant. ""I was much smaller than that and did not know how he was going to make me look like that until I saw the finished painting."" People we've lost in 2015. Keefe pocketed $10 for the two mornings of modeling work she did in Arlington, Vermont. Rockwell lived in neighboring West Arlington at the time. ""Rosie the Riveter"" is often confused with another popular image from the same era. The poster shows a woman flexing her arm under the slogan ""We Can Do It."" It was part of a nationwide campaign to sell war bonds, but is not the same character. Still, many folks on social media paid tribute to Keefe using the image.

Some are even saying it's the math equivalent of the ""What color is the dress"" debate. The puzzling problem went viral after Singapore television host Kenneth Kong posted it to Facebook. Cheryl's birthday challenge was meant to test the better high-school students competing in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad, held April 8. Here it is: Cheryl has a birthday, and she doesn't want to share it right away. (Otherwise, we have no challenge to solve.)

"A longtime friend of Joni Mitchell has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer-songwriter's conservator. Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: ""At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs."" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. ""Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital."" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that ""the website"" was accurate.

"About 20 hours after the Boston Marathon started Monday, many of the cheering crowds had dispersed and the streets were cleared. But one man, despite the odds against him, crossed the finish line. Venezuelan native Maickel Melamed, who is battling muscular dystrophy, completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. Tuesday. A group of energized fans rallied for the 39-year-old as he walked down Boylston Street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, Vamos. He was the last participant to complete the race, CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported.

"Five militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party were killed and another was wounded in clashes with Turkish armed forces in eastern Turkey, the country's military said Saturday. Four Turkish soldiers also were wounded in the fighting that took place in the eastern city of Agri, the armed forces said in a written statement. The Kurdish separatists opened fire from a long distance, targeting Turkish soldiers who were securing an area in Agri ahead of a spring festival, CNN Turk reported. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the violence and said via Twitter that ""the appropriate answer to the heinous attack in Agri is being given by the Turkish armed forces."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also harshly condemned the attack, describing it as the Kurdish separatists' attempt to ""intervene in the resolution process (with the Kurds) in our country."" Last month, Abdullah Ocalan, longtime leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), called from his jail cell for the violence to end. In a historic letter, he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms, stop their war against the Turkish state and join a ""congress"" to focus on the future. Since the first incidents more than three decades ago, an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost.

"Washington (CNN)A 54-year-old man carrying a suspicious package scaled a White House fence Sunday night, but was quickly apprehended. Jerome R. Hunt, of Hayward, California, climbed the fence on the south side of the White House complex about 10:25 p.m., said Brian Leary with the United States Secret Service. According to a source with knowledge of the investigation, the man made it 10 to 15 feet in on the South Lawn but ""was compliant"" once he saw the dogs ready to engage with thim. Hunt is in custody and charges are pending, Leary said. The package was being examined and later deemed to be harmless, a Secret Service source told CNN. Last week, a U.S. official told CNN that temporary steel spikes may be added to the tips of the White House perimeter fence to help deter jumpers. If done, this will be a temporary measure to protect the grounds until a new permanent one is constructed. The official said that the proposal is not in place yet. The Secret Service has come under heavy criticism after two incidents compromised the security of the grounds. On March 4, two senior Secret Service agents who were reportedly intoxicated allegedly drove their car into a White House barrier. Last September, a man jumped the White House fence and made it to an unlocked door on the grounds.

Jerome R. Hunt, of Hayward, California, climbed the fence on the south side of the White House complex about 10:25 p.m., said Brian Leary with the United States Secret Service. According to a source with knowledge of the investigation, the man made it 10 to 15 feet in on the South Lawn but ""was compliant"" once he saw the dogs ready to engage with thim. Hunt is in custody and charges are pending, Leary said. The package was being examined and later deemed to be harmless, a Secret Service source told CNN. Last week, a U.S. official told CNN that temporary steel spikes may be added to the tips of the White House perimeter fence to help deter jumpers. If done, this will be a temporary measure to protect the grounds until a new permanent one is constructed. The official said that the proposal is not in place yet. The Secret Service has come under heavy criticism after two incidents compromised the security of the grounds. On March 4, two senior Secret Service agents who were reportedly intoxicated allegedly drove their car into a White House barrier. Last September, a man jumped the White House fence and made it to an unlocked door on the grounds.

"Suzanne Crough, the child actress who portrayed youngest daughter Tracy on the '70s musical sitcom ""The Partridge Family,"" has died. She was 52. Crough passed away Monday at home in Laughlin, Nevada, the Clark County Coroner's Office said. Tracy played tambourine and percussion in the traveling ""Partridge Family"" band.

"The cast of ""The Breakfast Crew"" escaped from Principal Richard Vernon 30 years ago, but a draft script of the 1985 teen classic has just been found in a filing cabinet in the school district where it was filmed, the Chicago Tribune reported. ""One day a few weeks ago, one of the assistants was going through a filing cabinet and found a file that had a manuscript from 'The Breakfast Club' dated Sept. 21, 1983,"" Ken Wallace, superintendent of Maine Township High School District 207 in suburban Chicago, told the newspaper. ""It's a first draft of the screenplay by John Hughes,"" Wallace said. The manuscript sports the approval signature of the district's then-superintendent and reveals that Molly Ringwald's character, Claire Standish, was originally to be named Cathy Douglas, according to the Tribune. The movie was filmed at the Maine North High School building, which was auctioned off by the district years ago and is now occupied by the Illinois State Police, according to the Tribune. The file was discovered at Maine South High School as district officials prepared to move to a newly acquired building next door. Wallace told the Tribune that he would like to find a way to display the script as a piece of film -- and district -- history. ""The odds of having such an iconic movie filmed and associated with your district are astronomical,"" he told the newspaper.

"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has agreed to be interviewed by Swedish prosecutors in London, his lawyer in Sweden told CNN. Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. According to the lawyer, Thomas Olsson, Swedish prosecutors will now have to reach out to British and Ecuadorian authorities to request permission to conduct the interview at the embassy. The prosecutors previously balked at coming to Britain to question Assange. However, some of the alleged crimes will be subject to a statute of limitations in August 2015, according to a statement from Marianne Ny, the director of public prosecutions. Ny explained the logic behind the Swedish authorities' change of approach in her statement. ""My view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London would lower the quality of the interview, and that he would need to be present in Sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future,"" Ny said. ""This assessment remains unchanged. Now that time is of the essence, I have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward, particularly as there are no other measures on offer without Assange being present in Sweden."" The Australian national has not been charged and denies the claims. Assange has said he fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks. Ecuador granted Assange political asylum in 2012.

"Thousands sought refuge in temporary shelters in South Africa after mobs with machetes attacked immigrants in Durban, leaving at least five people dead, an aid group said Thursday.

The attacks in Durban killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. ""There has been an outpouring of support from ordinary South Africans who are disgusted with the attacks not only because they are foreign, or African, but because they are fellow human beings,"" said Gift of the Givers charity, which is helping those seeking refuge. ""We are preparing aid packages for those who may journey onwards to their home countries."" The charity said about 8,500 people fled to refugee centers or police stations this week because of the violence. That doesn't count anyone who fled their homes to other, private accommodations, the group said. It said it hopes the violence is limited to Durban, but assured immigrants that it has a facility in Johannesburg to help those who might need shelter there.

"Cairo (CNN)An Egyptian court has sentenced 71 people to life in prison for their role in the August 2013 burning of a Christian church in the Giza province village of Kafr Hakim, state news reports. The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an ""Islamic state,"" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt's official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt's military. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012. But he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters. Christian churches across Egypt stormed, torched.

"Sabra Dipping Co. is recalling 30,000 cases of hummus due to possible contamination with Listeria, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. The nationwide recall is voluntary. So far, no illnesses caused by the hummus have been reported. The potential for contamination was discovered when a routine, random sample collected at a Michigan store on March 30 tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. The FDA issued a list of the products in the recall. Anyone who has purchased any of the items is urged to dispose of or return it to the store for a full refund. Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, the FDA says. Although some people may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Sabra Dipping Co. is recalling 30,000 cases of hummus due to possible contamination with Listeria, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday.

Two people were shot in the neck and another was shot in the leg, spokesman Jeff Small said. There is a suspect in custody in the latter case: a 20-year-old male from St. Louis County. The two victims shot in the neck were hospitalized, Small said. ""Police are having a difficult time investigating because of the rocks being thrown at them,"" he said. ""At this point police are not sure if the (shootings are) linked to the protest or not."" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French posted video on his Twitter account.

"Washington (CNN)A shooting that prompted the lockdown of the U.S. Capitol for several hours Saturday was a suicide and does not have an apparent connection to terrorism, Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said in a news conference. An unidentified male walked through a public area on the west front of the Capitol early Saturday afternoon and shot himself, Dine told reporters. Witnesses told CNN dozens of shocked onlookers watched, including some young children. The unidentified shooter had a backpack and a rolling suitcase that authorities treated as treated suspicious packages, prompting the lockdown as they were investigated, Capitol police said. The male carried a sign with a message about ""social justice,"" authorities said. A witness, Robert Bishop, told CNN it also said something about taxing the ""1%."" Dine said there was ""no nexus to terrorism"" apparent so far in this incident. The building and the nearby Capitol Visitors Center were locked down, meaning tourists or any staff could not enter or leave the buildings. The Capitol area was crowded with tourists taking in the Cherry Blossom trees, which are in full bloom along the National Mall. Members of the Capitol police force, which responded to the scene, did not fire their weapons, Dine said. After the suspicious packages were examined, the lockdown was lifted about 3:50 p.m. ET and pedestrian traffic was allowed. Responding to the incident were the Metropolitan Police Department, which is investigating the death, as well as the FBI, Secret Service and Park Police. Many tourists at the scene were filming at the time and showed their photos and video to investigating law enforcement officers.

"Call it a little piece of heaven for a family torn apart by tragedy. Back in July, Sierra Sharry and Lane Smith were just about to become parents.  Sharry was eight months pregnant. But then Smith fell and hit his head.  He was taken to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City.  Smith never recovered.

When it was time for his 6-month pictures, Sharry had a special request. Maybe the photographer could make their family complete, just for one picture. ""They asked me if I would be willing to 'play around' with capturing their first family photo by editing Taos' daddy in one of their pictures,"" Kayli Rene' Photography posted on Facebook.

"At least 54 people have died and 15 others are missing after a Russian fishing vessel sank off the Kamchatka Peninsula, according to Russia's state-run Tass news agency. More than 60 people were rescued Thursday from the chilly waters in Russia's Far East. The Dalniy Vostok freezer trawler -- a commercial fishing vessel -- was carrying 132 people, the ministry said. Of the people on board, 78 were Russians. The 54 others were foreign nationals from Myanmar, Ukraine, Lithuania and Vanuatu, according to the news agency, with the majority coming from Myanmar. More than 20 fishing vessels are searching for the 15 people still thought to be missing, Tass said. The shipwreck was swift, with the trawler going down in the Sea of Okhotsk within 15 minutes of getting into difficulties, the news agency reported. The most likely cause of the shipwreck was collision with an obstacle which damaged the hull, the official spokesman of Russia's Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, is quoted as saying. The trawler is also thought to have keeled over as a result of hauling some 80 tons of fish on to the deck, the chairman of the emergencies commission in the Kamchatka region, Sergey Khabarov, told Tass.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'At least 54 people have died and 15 others are missing after a Russian fishing vessel sank off the Kamchatka Peninsula, according to Russia's state-run Tass news agency.

Two Florida corrections officers and one former officer trainee have been charged in a plot to kill a former inmate who was getting out of prison, the Florida Attorney General's office said Thursday. An FBI informant met the men -- Thomas Jordan Driver, 25; David Elliot Moran, 47; and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42 -- after infiltrating a branch of the KKK:  the Traditional American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, CNN affiliate WJXT reported. Driver told the informant that he had gotten into a fight with the inmate and that he and Moran wanted him ""six feet under,"" according to court documents.

"Duke University students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting ""We are not afraid. We stand together,""  after a noose was found hanging from a tree on campus. Duke officials have asked anyone with information about the rope noose, which was found near a student center at 2 a.m., to call campus police. Photos of the noose prompted outrage from the community as they were passed along on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was hung, hundreds of people gathered. ""You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' "" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a ""cowardly act."" ""To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,"" Larry Moneta said.

"A Detroit mother arrested last month after police discovered the bodies of two of her children inside a freezer was arraigned this week on murder and torture charges. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy charged Mitchelle Angela Blair on Wednesday with killing her then 13-year-old daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, and her then 9-year-old son, Stephen Gage Berry. According to Detroit Police Chief James Craig, the bodies were found wrapped in plastic inside the freezer by a bailiff performing a court ordered eviction on March 24. The Wayne County medical examiner has since determined that Stoni died from multiple blunt trauma injuries and Stephen from multiple blunt trauma and thermal injuries. Both were determined to be homicides, according to spokesman Ryan Bridges. According to CNN affiliate WDIV,  investigators believe Stephen was scalded with hot water, beaten and strangled in August 2012, while Stoni was killed in May 2013. A message left for Blair's court appointed attorney, who entered not guilty pleas on her behalf at her arraignment, wasn't immediately returned. In addition to the two counts of premeditated murder -- each of which carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole --  Blair, 35, has been charged with two counts of torture, four counts of felony child abuse and one count of committing child abuse in the presence of another child. She has two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, both of whom are now in in protective custody, according to Worthy.

"""It's showtime!"" Michael Keaton paid homage -- ever so slightly -- to his roles in ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Batman"" in his third turn hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" this weekend. Keaton acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982. ""I had a baby -- he's 31. I also have a new girlfriend -- she's 28,"" he said. Fans who were hoping for a full-blown revival of Keaton's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed. SNL cast members Taran Killam and Bobby Moynihan begged the actor with a song to ""play"" Batman and Beetlejuice with them. All they got in response were a couple of one-liners. Overall, Keaton's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its ""deadpan"" manner and ""unpredictable weirdness,"" in the words of A.V. Club's Dennis Perkins. Fans also delighted in a cameo from ""Walking Dead"" star Norman Reedus during Weekend Update. Keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who's not very good at his job, a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy ""She's All That."" Other crowd-pleasing spots included a Scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the NCAA student-athlete debate. The show also poked fun at CNN with cast member Cecily Strong playing anchor Brooke Baldwin. Baldwin said on Twitter that she's taking it as a ""crazy compliment"" and shared a clip from the skit.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: '""It's showtime!""

Fans also delighted in a cameo from ""Walking Dead"" star Norman Reedus during Weekend Update. Keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who's not very good at his job, a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy ""She's All That."" Other crowd-pleasing spots included a Scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the NCAA student-athlete debate. The show also poked fun at CNN with cast member Cecily Strong playing anchor Brooke Baldwin. Baldwin said on Twitter that she's taking it as a ""crazy compliment"" and shared a clip from the skit.'

"Johannesburg (CNN)South African troops deployed Tuesday evening as part of a new government effort to stop deadly anti-immigrant violence. Their first target: the Johannesburg suburb of Jeppestown, where xenophobic violence broke out on Friday. South African police raided a Jeppestown hostel Tuesday while troops secured the perimeter. Earlier, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula announced the plan to deploy an undisclosed number of troops to areas where police are spread too thin while trying to curb deadly attacks against immigrants. ""This intervention is not an indictment on the police. ... We are coming in because they need that support,"" she said after visiting Johannesburg's Alexandra township, one area where mobs have attacked immigrants from other African nations and looted their shops -- ostensibly based on the belief that immigrants are taking South Africans' jobs. Seven people have been killed in recent violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors. Xenophobic killing caught by photographer. Much of this month's violence happened in the port city of Durban, where at least two foreigners and three South Africans were killed after mobs with machetes attacked immigrant shops. Thousands of people took temporary shelter at refugee centers or police stations as a result, according to aid group Gift of the Givers. Similar violence happened late last week in Johannesburg, where immigrant-owned shops were looted or destroyed. The attacks came as residents accused immigrants of taking their jobs and committing crimes. The unemployment rate in South Africa is 25%, according to government figures. The United Nations said the attacks began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. What's behind the xenophobic attacks in South Africa? CNN's Brent Swails reported from Johannesburg.

"A New York City detective has been suspended after being accused of stealing $3,000 during an illegal cigarettes raid, according to police spokesman Stephen Davis. Surveillance video obtained by CNN affiliate News 12 Brooklyn appears to show Det. Ian Cyrus stashing cash in a bag before leaving the Yemen Deli and Grocery store in Brooklyn last Friday. The detectives had arrested two employees for selling loose cigarettes, according to News 12 Brooklyn. Ali Abdullah, the store's manager, noticed the money was gone from a box, but assumed it was taken by one of his employees. When he checked the cameras he couldn't believe what he saw, he told News 12 Brooklyn. Cyrus, who is under investigation by the internal affairs bureau, could not be reached for comment. His supervisor Sgt.

"Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported. Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported. The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. ""Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,"" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an ""act of terrorism."" ""The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,"" the government said in a statement Wednesday. If the militants entered Pakistan after the attack, ""they will be apprehended and brought to justice,"" it said.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported.

"The ""Star Wars"" universe keeps on expanding. Details of the plot for 2016's ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" were revealed during a panel at Star Wars Celebration fan festival Sunday in Anaheim, California. Director Gareth Edwards (""Godzilla"") showed an early teaser for the movie and revealed plot details for the ""Star Wars"" anthology film (the term Disney prefers instead of ""spinoff""), starring Felicity Jones. The movie will take place in between ""Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" and ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" (known to many as the first ""Star Wars"" movie from 1977). A group of rebels go on a rogue mission to steal plans for the Death Star. Jones will play a rebel soldier. The movie won't begin shooting until this summer so the footage shown in the teaser -- including a glimpse of the Death Star -- won't necessarily appear in the finished product. Edwards told the crowd that Jones is a ""Star Wars"" fan and dropped everything to take on the lead role. Producer Kathleen Kennedy said ""Rogue One"" was one of the first pitches she received after becoming president of Lucasfilm in 2012, and she could not turn it down. It was one of the final events at Celebration, where fans gather to talk about ""Star Wars,"" dress in costumes, look for rare ""Star Wars"" merchandise and learn about future projects for the franchise. The convention kicked off with the well-received trailer for this year's ""The Force Awakens."" Costumes and props from that movie also were on display. Anything bearing the movie logo was a hot item for collectors. Tens of thousands are expected to have attended the event when all is said and done. ""Rogue One"" is scheduled to hit theaters December 16, 2016.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'The ""Star Wars"" universe keeps on expanding.

"Civil unions between people of the same sex will soon be recognized in Chile. The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. ""This is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples,"" Bachelet said. The new law will take effect in six months. It will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman. The Chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change. The law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples, such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital, make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance. A number of South American nations have moved to allow same-sex civil unions in recent years.

The frustrated elephant attempts to squirt water on the bull which has wandered too close for comfort. Its young elephant cozies up to its parent for protection, as the bull drinks from a small pool of water.

"Amazing pictures have emerged of  blue fluorescent algae lighting up Australia's east coast. The images were taken in Jervis Bay, the south coast of NSW, as the neon glow illuminated one of Australia's popular beaches. Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a 'beautiful supernatural scene' caused by millions of plankton omitting light. A similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014 where an oceanography expert told Daily Mail Australia there was no need to be concerned about the algae. 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Iain Suthers, of University of New South Wales, said.

"Get ready to dig deep - the impulse to buy a treat peaks today at 12.52pm. A study claims that Britons spend an average of £62 a week on rewarding themselves, with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today. Treats can range from as little as a bar of chocolate or a glass of wine to designer clothes and shoes, according to research by website VoucherCodes.co.uk. A study reveals that Britons spend an average of £62 a week on rewarding themselves, with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today. Treats can range from a bar of chocolate to a glass of wine. And surprisingly, men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves. They are also more likely to lie about their expenditure and hide items they have purchased from their partners in a desperate quest to keep their shopping habits under wraps, a different survey last year found. The shoppers of Swansea are the most frivolous, with 44 per cent splurging as soon as they are paid, followed by those in Aberdeen (42 per cent) and Belfast (39 per cent). The most cautious spenders live in Wolverhampton, where only 19 per cent choose to treat themselves on pay day. Designer items (stock image above) are also popular buys and men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves, the research claims. Other research claimed the average Brit spends £153 within 24 hours of payday - while 10 per cent splurge more than £500. Some workers said they spend so much in the 24 hours after payday because they had arranged their regular payments and direct debits to leave their accounts around that time. While others said it was because they felt like they deserved the treat.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Get ready to dig deep - the impulse to buy a treat peaks today at 12.52pm.

"Arachnophobes beware - the following will make your blood run cold. A Victorian driver got a rude shock when a massive huntsman crawled out from inside his door handle. The spine-tinging video, which was captured in Wangaratta, northeast Victoria, begins with the man approaching his black Holden Ute and spraying the door with an insect repellent. The driver  sprays his car with insect repellent, forcing a huntsman spider to reveal itself from under the door handle. ‘Get out, you bast***,’ he stoically says to the spider. But the man appears less composed when the hairy huntsman’s legs pop out, yelping and cowering back in fright. ‘That’s the creepiest thing ever,’ he says between yelling expletives. ‘It’s a bloody super-spider!’ Having endured  enough of the spray, the spider drops onto road and retreats underneath the vehicle. 'Yeah, I love living in the bush,' declares the man. The spider drops onto road and retreats underneath the vehicle, much to the drivers relief. The video has already garnered hundreds of thousands of view on social media since being uploaded on Friday.

"Most fans wants to get their hands on a rare piece of memorabilia once belonging to their favourite player or team and little bits of history can fetch thousands of pounds on the open market. But you may be surprised to know that an expired passport of Paul Parker - most famous for playing right back for Manchester United and England during the nineties - was listed on eBay for an eye-watering £5,000. The item was listed earlier in March and bidding ended on Tuesday but it is unclear whether anyone actually stumped up the sizeable sum being quoted. Ex-Manchester United and England defender Paul Parker's old passport was listed on eBay. The former defender's expired passport was listed for £5,000 but the seller was open to offers. 'This listing was ended by the seller because the item is no longer available,' read the message on eBay. Although the old passport was listed for £5,000, the seller made it clear he was open to negotiation, asking potential buyers to 'make me an offer and see if I accept'. Parker (right) played for Manchester United between 1991 and 1996 and won two league titles at Old Trafford. Parker closes down Holland forward Marco van Basten during one of his 19 caps for England. The eBay seller described Parker, 50, as an 'ex-Manchester United and Chelsea legend' but, while he made more than 100 appearances for United and won two league titles, his grand total of four outings for the Blues doesn't quite merit legendary status. Parker made 19 international appearances but his United and England career ended largely because of the emergence of Gary Neville.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Most fans wants to get their hands on a rare piece of memorabilia once belonging to their favourite player or team and little bits of history can fetch thousands of pounds on the open market.

Although the old passport was listed for £5,000, the seller made it clear he was open to negotiation, asking potential buyers to 'make me an offer and see if I accept'. Parker (right) played for Manchester United between 1991 and 1996 and won two league titles at Old Trafford. Parker closes down Holland forward Marco van Basten during one of his 19 caps for England. The eBay seller described Parker, 50, as an 'ex-Manchester United and Chelsea legend' but, while he made more than 100 appearances for United and won two league titles, his grand total of four outings for the Blues doesn't quite merit legendary status. Parker made 19 international appearances but his United and England career ended largely because of the emergence of Gary Neville.'

"Karim Benzema showed his talents aren't just limited to the football pitch as the Real Madrid star posted a video showcasing his rapping skills while cruising along in his Bugatti Veyron. As Real Madrid prepare for their La Liga clash against Granada at the Bernabeu on Sunday, Benzema shared a video of him singing along to Tupac's classic track 'Check Out Time'. Tupac's track 'All Eyez on me' might have been a more suitable choice for the Los Blancos star, however, as Benzema looks to add to his goal tally of 20 goals in all competitions so far this season. Real Madrid and France forward Karim Benzema sings along to Tupac in his Bugatti Veyron. Benzema boldly stated earlier this week that he can win the Ballon d'Or award during his career. The France international is confident his club success at the Bernabeu can force his way into contention for the prestigious award. However, Benzema's Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has picked up the last two accolades for the world's best footballer whereas Barcelona talisman Lionel Messi prevailed between 2009-12. Benzema vents his frustration during France's recent 3-1 loss to Brazil at the Stade de France in Paris. Despite the duo's dominance, Benzema is adamant he can compete for the title if he continues to perform for Real Madrid and at international level. 'If I keep winning titles then I can win this award in future,' he told Le Parisien. 'We have Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, the two best players. We know I won't reach 80 or 100 goals in a season. They can do that.'

"Villagers from Shandong Province in eastern China have reportedly resorted to transporting natural gas in plastic bags. Recent images show intrepid residents from Lijin village in Dongying city carry the explosive in bags as long as six metres on rickshaws, reported the People’s Daily Online. Worried passers-by compared this behaviour to carrying a bomb on their backs because any contact with a naked flame or even a cigarette could spell disaster. Gas-guzzler: Carrying natural gas in huge plastic bags is a common scene in some villages in Shandong. Penny-pinching: Local media suggest this is a way for villages to save money on the transportation of gas. This reckless behaviour has been reported on as early as May 2011 in Zibo city in Shandong. It has since spread to different parts of the province. Netizens and media suggest this is a way for the locals to save money on transportation. Some suggest they are actually stealing gas. An earlier undercover investigation by Anhui Satellite TV Station shows that villagers in Zibo have little understanding of the dangers, claiming it to be safe. Unaware of danger: Previous investigation discovered that residents had little understanding of the hazards. The news clip documented villagers and even school pupils stealing gas from a large roadside container. Their plastic bags were inflated within minutes, and they carried them off before someone else came along to do the same. Villagers told the undercover reporter transporting gas this way isn't dangerous at all. Questions are now being raised within China about why the authorities have taken no steps to ban this practise after all these years. Unprotected: The gas bags are sealed in a basic manner. Passers-by worry they could spell disaster any time.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Villagers from Shandong Province in eastern China have reportedly resorted to transporting natural gas in plastic bags.

And there are no two baseball teams that are greater, or more storied, than eternal rivals the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, who come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite. Also making a very impressive showing are the Texas Rangers and Atlanta Braves, who have fans across a wide area in the South. Then there are a few teams who don't get as much love - like the New York Mets. Scroll down for video.

Dougie Fife, Alasdair Dickinson and Ross Ford were all rested for last week's Guinness Pro12 26-15 win over Scarlets in Llanelli following their efforts for the Dark Blues during the RBS Six Nations. But the trio have been recalled by head coach Alan Solomons for the Madejski Stadium clash with the Exiles as the South African looks to name is strongest XV. Dougie Fife is one of a trio of Scottish players returning to Edinburgh following Six Nations duty. England's Courtney Lawes (left) is tackled by Scotland's Ross Ford (centre) and David Denton. He said: 'When one gets to the play-off stage of a competition each game is a one-off. We are well aware of that and know that we will need to be at our best on Sunday.' Fife returns to the right wing while the rest of the backline remains in place following last Saturday's victory in Wales. Jack Cuthbert starts at full-back, with Tim Visser on the left wing. The centre pairing of Andries Strauss and Phil Burleigh is retained, while scrum half Sam Hidlago-Clyne - the competition's top scorer with 53 points - and stand-off Greig Tonks continue their half-back combo. Edinburgh coach Alan Solomons has named his strongest XV heading into the key clash with London Irish. In the pack, prop Dickinson and hooker Ford reclaim their places, with Willem Nel remaining at tighthead. Anton Bresler and Ben Toolis start in the second row lock. Captain Mike Coman misses out after sustaining a head knock against Scarlets, so Roddy Grant moves up from the bench to start as blindside flanker.

"Brazil's World Cup stadium in Natal is up for sale as the company that owns it is suffering from cash flow problems following a corruption scandal. Natal's Dunas Arena is being sold by owner Grupo OAS, with the company also trying to sell the 50 percent share it owns of the Fonte Nova arena in Salvador. The company has struggled for months with the impact of a corruption investigation at state-controlled oil company Petrobras, which undercut the builder's access to financing. A general view of Natal's Dunas Arena during the World Cup match between Italy and Uruguay last year. An economic downturn, government austerity and a slumping currency has also taken its toll, leading to Grupo OAS to announce it is selling its stakes in the stadiums and other businesses to focus on the core construction business. OAS spent 591 million reais (around £126 million) on completely rebuilding the old Fonte Nova arena in Salvador and 423 million reais (£90 million) on the new Dunas area. The Fonte Nova hosted six games in the 2014 tournament and the Dunas Arena four. The announcement was the latest in a string of bad news for Brazilian football post-World Cup. Holland take on Costa Rica in a World Cup quarter-final at Salvador's Fonte Nova arena last July. Earlier this week Esporte Club Bahia, one of the biggest clubs in Salvador, said they were abandoning plans to use the Fonte Nova because they felt the owners did not respect their fans. Several other stadiums have seen bigger crowds for concerts and religious events than for football and the ground in Cuiaba was closed because of structural problems.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Brazil's World Cup stadium in Natal is up for sale as the company that owns it is suffering from cash flow problems following a corruption scandal.

Zavala holds his shoulder after being bitten by Arango, in the game Zavala's side won 4-3. Zavala shows the referee the mark on his shoulder after being bittern by Arango. Arango (right) earlier scored a magnificent free kick to bring his club Tijuana team level against Monterrey. 'I spoke to him after the game and apologised, it was a very hot-blooded game, I got heated up, I took that negative attitude, that isn't me but unfortunately it happened. We exchanged shirts after the game, we spoke and that's it over.' Zavala fell to the ground and later posted a photo of the bit mark on social media. The incident was reminiscent of Uryguayan Luis Suarez's bite on Italian Giorgio Cheillini's shoulder during last year's World Cup. Suarez was given a nine-game suspension from international matches and a four-month ban from league action. The referee in Sunday's Mexican league game ended the game seconds after the bite and did not take action against Arango. The league's disciplinary commission could still punish him.

"No Tiger Woods and no Rory McIlroy in the field is proving no problem in Houston, where record numbers have descended on the small suburb of Humble for the Shell Houston Open. The last tournament before the Masters is proving quite a show-stopper itself thanks to the crowd-pleasing antics of the popular Phil Mickelson and local boy Jordan Spieth. It’s 18 months now since Spieth attracted criticism for giving up on university and joining the PGA Tour as the 809th ranked player in the world. Spieth, only 21, has since risen to number four in the world. Funnily enough, no-one’s criticising him anymore. Spectators have flocked to see Texas local boy Jordan Spieth in action at the Shell Houston Open. Spieth's fellow American Phil Mickelson has also impressed in the run up to the Masters. In seven starts this season Spieth, who finished runner-up on his Masters debut last year, has finished outside the top seven only twice, and here a second-round 66 lifted him to within three shots of the leader, Andrew Putnam. As for Mickelson, he’d hardly played a decent shot this year before posting rounds of 66 and 67 to be one stroke behind at halfway. The stage was set beautifully, therefore, for the two Americans at opposite ends of their careers. Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey were also going well at five shots off the pace.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'No Tiger Woods and no Rory McIlroy in the field is proving no problem in Houston, where record numbers have descended on the small suburb of Humble for the Shell Houston Open.

"The Miami Open is threatening to turn into national cake week, after Serena Williams became the latest recipient of a giant celebration present after she clocked her 700th career victory. The day following Andy Murray’s 500th win another huge cake was wheeled out to mark Williams reaching the semi-final with a 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 progression over Germany’s Sabine Lisicki. Williams’s hopes of another meeting with sister Venus were dashed by her elder sibling’s defeat to Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro, but the world No 1 was intent on staying alive in what is the nearest thing she has to a hometown event. Serena Williams strikes a pose next to her cake after recording her 700th career victory. Williams beat Sabine Lisicki in three sets on Wednesday to progress to the semi-finals of the Miami Open. Willaims celebrates as the world No 1 sealed a match against either Sloane Stephens or Simona Halep. Andy Murray pretends to take a bite out a celebratory cake presented to him after winning his 500th match. In a battle of two huge servers, Williams seemed to give away the second set but eventually gained a measure of revenge for the shock defeat she suffered at Wimbledon 2013 against the same opponent, who has never quite been the same since. Williams will face Romania's Simona Halep for a place in the final after the third-seed beat Sloane Stephens 6-1, 7-5. Williams plays a backhand during her quarter-final at Crandon Park in Florida on Wednesday. Lisicki and Williams shake hands at the net after the tight match at the Miami Open.

"Pupils could face disruption to classes as teachers prepare to vote on a national walkout over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of teachers could strike in the autumn, potentially causing temporary school closures. The National Union of Teachers is expected to call for a vote on industrial action this weekend over the prospect of looming funding cuts. Strike threat: Members of the National Union of Teachers is expected to call for a vote on industrial action this weekend, like the strike here in 2013. The ballot of its 300,000 members would take place after the election, with strikes possible from September. The last time teachers across the country went on strike was in July, when 21 per cent of schools were forced to close – leaving parents having to pay for childcare or take a day off work. A motion to hold a ballot on strike action was announced yesterday at the NUT annual conference in Harrogate, with a debate expected tomorrow. Disruption: Tens of thousands of teachers could strike in the autumn, potentially causing temporary school closures. Members will be asked to consider funding shortages in schools, which the union said would lead to redundancies. NUT deputy general secretary Kevin Courtney said education will face a ‘terrible set of cuts’ if action is not taken. Last month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested schools could see cuts of up to 12 per cent over the next parliament.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Pupils could face disruption to classes as teachers prepare to vote on a national walkout over pay and conditions.

The video, inspired by action films, shows the two literally saving 'the date' as they wash up on shore, fight friends disguised as villains and ultimately escape from one very large explosion.

"David Luiz could be a doubt for Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League clash with Barcelona after picking up a hamstring injury on Sunday. The Brazilian defender went off after 35 minutes of PSG's 3-2 win over Marseille after suffering an injjury to his left leg. Shortly after his side had fallen behind in their top of the table clash,the Brazilian was running away from a Marseille player, before being caught by a stray leg. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury.

"Gearing up for tonight's NCAA championship game, a group of meerkats have been testing out their basketball skills. The critters were filmed at Indiana's Indianapolis Zoo after getting a makeshift backboard and hoop installed in their pen. Footage shows them inquisitively inspecting the piece of sports apparatus and standing  tall on their back legs. However, instead of an even-surfaced court, they're forced to contend with the hilly floor of their enclosure. Spectators were seen smiling as they watched the team of animals in action.

"Dogs are usually maestros when it comes to games of throw and catch - especially when there's food involved. But Fritz the Golden Retriever from California appears to lack any eye-mouth co-ordination skills, as a new video shows. The pooch was filmed wearing bunny ears this Easter trying - and miserably failing - to catch a hard-boiled egg between his teeth. Slow-motion footage shows him licking his lips and enthusiastically leaping up to catch the treat. However, despite his best efforts, the egg narrowly misses his jaw, bounces off his chest and hits the grass instead. A defeated Fritz is then seen hanging his head low, with his bunny ears falling to the ground. The pup has made quite a name for himself with his poor catching skills. Indeed, his YouTube channel boasts more than five million hits. Other videos show him being thrown steak, tacos, bread rolls, pizza and donuts, with misses every time. Fritz's owner, Evan Ball, hopes that one day the dog will be able to achieve the 'paw-fect' catch. He added: 'While we all intently anticipate the day when Fritz masters the skill of catching food in his mouth, we also patiently embrace the journey.'

When the first egg emerges she cries  for joy and when the third comes she lets out a shriek with her arms waving around. Before laying its eggs - which are unfortunately plastic, not chocolate - the toy bird plays a short song. 'I'm about to show you how it's done, laying eggs is so much fun,' it chimes.

"An Australian goanna has been filmed swallowing a whole rabbit in under one minute. The footage shows the two-metre long reptile managing to balance at the top of the pole while swallowing its prey. The lizard swings its neck back and forth as it battles to swallow its catch, before managing to finish the feat in under a minute. Scroll down for video. The grisly footage shows the ravenous reptile battling to swallow its ill-fated prey. The video begins by closing in on the top of a towering power pole, where the goanna is perched with the rabbit. Prominent in Aboriginal mythology, goannas can unhinge their lower jaws when feeding, allowing them to eat over-sized prey. They are  not picky with their choice of food either, consuming anything from insects to birds and eggs through to large mammals like possums and cats. They even eat dead and rotten animals, and are attracted to the smell of rotten meat. The video, uploaded to YouTube last week, begins with the message: ‘Goanna swallows rabbit, some people may find this video a bit disturbing, but it’s only nature.’ Goannas, which come from the monitor lizard family, are found throughout most of Australia, but it’s unknown where the clip was filmed. The lizard swings its neck back and forth as it battles to swallow the catch, before managing to finish the feat in under a minute. Goannas can unhinge their lower jaws when feeding, allowing them to dispose of some staggering sized prey including the likes of possums and cats.

But that match proved to be his only appearance at senior level and he never again progressed from the second XI.

"Ludogorets player Cosmin Moti is guilty of producing one of the worst tackles you're likely to see this season after his kung-fu style tackle on a CSKA Sofia player - but unbelievably the referee waved play on. It was a kick Eric Cantona would have been proud of, as he connected cleanly with Stefan Nikolic's rib-cage and sending his opponent crashing to the floor. The defender made the headlines for the right reasons during Ludogorets Champions League play-off against Steaua Bucharest back in August, when he saved two penalties during the shoot-out - after their goalkeeper had been sent off. Cosmin Moti (centre right) kung-fu tacklesStefan Nikolic during Ludogorets clash with CSKA Sofia. His heroics sent the Bulgarian side through to the Champions League group stages as he established himself as a club legend. But Moti's kick on Nikolic shows a different side and the misdemeanor during the first half went unpunished as his side went on to win the contest 4-0 - sending them six points clear of their rivals at the top. It could have been so different for the away side if he had been given his marching orders but due to some shocking refereeing, that wasn't the case. The defender leaps up and aims his right foot at the forward but wasn't sent off for the tackle. Moti connects cleanly Nikolic's rib cage but the referee waved play on - much to the disgust of CSKA. The forward screams in pain after the horrific tackle and lands heavily on the Ludogorets pitch.

To make matters worse the Irish rugby legend's wife Amy Huberman caught wind of the picture on social media, with hilarious consequences.

Amy Huberman shares a joke with her husband in the Royal Box at Wimbledon last summer. The couple are pictured attending a Downing Street reception following the victorious 2013 Lions tour. On Monday, at home in Ireland, actress Huberman posted the picture of O'Driscoll and wrote: 'You know when your husband is away in Hong Kong on a very important business trip...'

Sportsmail understands Tottenham have major concerns about the striker playing in the summer — and will convey those views to Wembley chiefs. England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed this week that Kane will be available for the competition in the Czech Republic, despite playing for the seniors in recent clashes against Lithuania and Italy. Harry Kane celebrates after opening his account against Lithuania in his England senior debut. Kane could find himself at the centre of a club vs country row ahead of the U21 European Championships. But Spurs fear Kane may suffer burnout and see him as key to the club’s PR strategy ahead of their post-season tour of Australia and Malaysia. Pochettino, who confirmed Hugo Lloris will miss tomorrow’s clash against Burnley with a gashed knee, said: ‘Can he play for the Under 21s? Why not?

"A dog left in critical condition after being repeatedly stabbed in a violent attack, is on the road to recovery. The sandy-colored canine was found sprawled in a pool of his own blood on a rural road in Cass County, North Dakota. The animal, who has been named Wilford by his rescuers, needed more than 50 stitches after being set upon with an eight inch blade. Wilford has been nursed back to health by a foster family and is now slowly returning to his paws. Survivor: Wilford is on the road to recovery after being found stabbed in Cass County, North Dakota. He doesn't seem traumatized,' foster mother Ellen Brisch, from 4 Luv Of Dog Rescue, reportedly told Valley News Live. 'He loves people and he's very happy with us.' In the days after the attack Ellen, from the non profit organisation, focused on making sure Wilford got lots of rest and took his medication. Two weeks on, she told how she is now noticing the spring return to the dog's step. 'Giving them another chance is really important,' Brisch told the website. When Wilford was found, authorities said he had no collar, tags or micro-chip.

"French giants Paris Saint-Germain have been dealt a major blow with the news that David Luiz will miss the Champions League clash with Barcelona. The former Chelsea man pulled up clutching his hamstring following a bursting run against Andre-Pier Gignac in the first-half of Sunday’s game against rivals Marseille. Current French champions PSG went on to win the game but the news of Luiz’ injury came as a major worry. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury. The Brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced. And those worries have since been confirmed as scans revealed the Brazilian will be out of action for at least four weeks meaning he will miss both legs of the quarter-final tie with Barcelona. Laurent Blanc’s side are still fighting for the Ligue One title and could be forced to play eight matches without the 27-year-old. PSG currently sit top of the pile in France just one point ahead of Lyon in second.

Smartphones are the most common internet-enabled device, at 1.7 per household, followed by laptops (1.3) and tablets (1.2), the YouGov poll of more than 2,000 consumers found. Four in 10 households now own one tablet, one fifth  have two, and 11 per cent own three or more. Top of the table: Smartphones are the most popular item, with an average of 1.7 per household. The latest Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) UK Digital Adspend report, conducted by PwC, found digital advertising hit a record £7.2billion. IAB chief strategy officer Tim Elkington said: 'Advertisers are increasing their digital budgets to reach people as they go online through an increasing array of devices. 'It's a win-win for consumers, because digital advertising pays for the wide range of free online services they increasingly rely on in their daily lives, but don't necessarily want to pay much for.' The survey found the average Briton who is online is willing to pay a maximum of £1.53 a month for their email service, £1.33 to use search engines, £1.10 for video content, 92p for news websites, 88p for social media, 55p for online games and 52p for price comparison sites. Popular: Laptops were second, followed by tablets - with a fifth of homes owning two of the latter. Just over half of people said banking and finance was the area of their lives that would be most affected without the internet or mobile phone, followed by keeping up with current events (42 per cent), shopping (38 per cent) and their relationships with friends and family (37 per cent).","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'The average household now owns 7.4 internet devices and four in 10 bought a tablet in the last year.

"This is the surreal moment a dog takes the reins and literally drags his owner out for a walk. Dashcam footage, shared by dailymotion.com user Vidsking, shows a giant St. Bernard  running across a road somewhere in the Czech Republic with a child trailing behind. It appears to be a rather uncomfortable excursion, with the young boy going along the ground on his belly with his legs stretched out behind.

"Blackburn Rovers boss Gary Bowyer has challenged star striker Jordan Rhodes to become an FA Cup hero as the Championship underdogs face Liverpool in the first full house at Ewood Park since 2011. Rovers rejected a £12million bid from Hull City for Scotland international Rhodes at the start of the season — a decision that will be vindicated should the 17-goal striker score the winner in Wednesday night's sixth-round replay and take his side to Wembley. ‘Someone has got to be the hero for Blackburn Rovers,’ said Bowyer. ‘We will need heroes in terms of defending and work-rate, but we also need a match-winner and there is probably no-one better than Jordan Rhodes. Hopefully he can step up and have his name in lights.’ Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer has said Jordan Rhodes (centre) can become an Ewood Park hero. Rhodes goes into the FA Cup replay on the back of scoring in Blackburn's 3-0 win over Leeds. Rovers were a laughing stock when they were last in the FA Cup quarter-finals in 2013 and only 8,000 turned up at Ewood Park to see them lose to Millwall, but Bowyer said: ‘There will be an extra 20,000 people in the stadium compared to that game against Millwall. 'I think it’s recognition from the supporters who have realised the amount of hard work that’s gone into what we’re trying to do, myself and the staff.’ Blackburn’s run is even more impressive because of a restricted squad of 24 players due to breaching Financial Fair Play rules. They also have injuries to Josh King, Chris Taylor, Rudy Gestede and Grant Hanley. Rovers boss Bowyer believes his side will be buoyed by the 'extra 20,000 people' at Ewood Park.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Blackburn Rovers boss Gary Bowyer has challenged star striker Jordan Rhodes to become an FA Cup hero as the Championship underdogs face Liverpool in the first full house at Ewood Park since 2011.

'I think it’s recognition from the supporters who have realised the amount of hard work that’s gone into what we’re trying to do, myself and the staff.’ Blackburn’s run is even more impressive because of a restricted squad of 24 players due to breaching Financial Fair Play rules. They also have injuries to Josh King, Chris Taylor, Rudy Gestede and Grant Hanley. Rovers boss Bowyer believes his side will be buoyed by the 'extra 20,000 people' at Ewood Park.'

Superintendent Louise Jorgensen said reports of drunken and foolish behaviour are highly frustrating for police. 'People are dismayed when we can't respond to their jobs immediately, but this is why — because of all these other jobs that are coming in. 'General duties police are run off their feet by anti-social behaviour and Alice Springs is in a similar position.' There were over 500 calls made to Northern Territory police between 3pm-11pm on Wednesday, most of them domestics or drunken anti-social behaviour. The 38-year-old man had reportedly chewed and swallowed the entire glass bottle before lying down, at which point his family called Royal Darwin Hospital (pictured)' Provide only the summary as the response.",5ec44a004fc74c0693e6141221df17bc

"A Brazilian online football store claims to have next season's Chelsea kit for sale on its website - and it can be purchased with Gareth Bale's name on the back. The website has published three Chelsea kits with the incoming 'Yokohama' sponsor across the front, albeit without the Adidas emblem, the club's kit manufacturer. But perhaps most bizarrely, or interestingly from the perspective of Chelsea supporters, the alleged new kit can be bought with 'Bale 9' on the back. A Brazilian website is claiming to have the new Chelsea kit for sale, with Gareth Bale's name on the back. Bale (centre) has struggled at Real Madrid this season and reports have linked him with a return to England. The website has the new sponsor on the front of the kits but not the Adidas emblem. Bale's struggles at Real Madrid have been well documented, with fans and the Spanish media casting him as the man to blame as Ancelotti's stuttering side have been replaced atop La Liga by Barcelona. Reports both in England and Spain have linked the Wales international with a return to the Premier League. Skeptical Chelsea supporters who wish to purchase the kit without Bale's name on the back may also want to avoid getting one with a mention of Didier Drogba.

The website has published three Chelsea kits with the incoming 'Yokohama' sponsor across the front, albeit without the Adidas emblem, the club's kit manufacturer. But perhaps most bizarrely, or interestingly from the perspective of Chelsea supporters, the alleged new kit can be bought with 'Bale 9' on the back. A Brazilian website is claiming to have the new Chelsea kit for sale, with Gareth Bale's name on the back. Bale (centre) has struggled at Real Madrid this season and reports have linked him with a return to England. The website has the new sponsor on the front of the kits but not the Adidas emblem. Bale's struggles at Real Madrid have been well documented, with fans and the Spanish media casting him as the man to blame as Ancelotti's stuttering side have been replaced atop La Liga by Barcelona. Reports both in England and Spain have linked the Wales international with a return to the Premier League. Skeptical Chelsea supporters who wish to purchase the kit without Bale's name on the back may also want to avoid getting one with a mention of Didier Drogba. Drogba's Chelsea deal expires at the end of the season and he has not yet signed a new contract.

"Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has claimed that Red Bull have launched a bid to buy the Championship club. Cellino, who is currently serving a Football League disqualification, said that Leeds' majority shareholder Eleonora Sport was considering the offer. But Leeds chairman Andrew Umbers said he was not aware of an offer from Red Bull when contacted by BBC Radio Leeds on Saturday morning. Leeds United are the subject of a takeover bid from Red Bull, according to owner Massimo Cellino. Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post that majority shareholders Eleonora Sport were considering an offer. Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'There is an offer. I didn’t know about it but I spoke just now with Giampaolo Caboni, one of the directors of Eleonora Sport. 'He said Red Bull has made an offer for the club. The shareholder will have to think about it. I don’t know what they will do.' The soft drink giant already own three clubs - RB Leipzig in Germany, Red Bull Salzburg in Austria and MLS side New York Red Bulls - as well as two teams in Formula One. After being linked with a bid in November, Red Bull issued a statement saying: 'Red Bull has no plans to take over Leeds Utd nor take a stake in the club.' Cellino was disqualified from running the club in December after an Italian court found him guilty of tax evasion and his ban ends on May 4. The soft drink giants own three football clubs, one of them in Austria (pictured) called Red Bull Salzburg. New York Red Bulls from America's MLS take on Arsenal in a pre-season friendly last summer.

"The owner of a takeaway where pizza boxes were filled with mouse droppings and mouldy tomato puree was used as a topping has been fined nearly £15,000. Council inspectors also found filthy food preparation areas at the mice-ridden Pizza Plus Fried Chicken business run by Kunaratnam Kunanatha, 36, in Gillingham. Kunanathan, of Catford, London, admitted seven offences under food safety and hygiene regulations at Medway Magistrates’ Court. Disgusting: Mould was seen growing in the tomato puree during an inspection of the takeaway in Gillingham. They included a lack of cleaning, having an uncontrolled mice infestation and selling unfit food. He also admitted two health and safety charges including a failure to maintain the electrical installation to prevent danger. He was fined £14,500 and ordered to pay £2,793 in costs. The court heard officers from Medway Council immediately closed the premises in Gillingham, Kent in January 2014 as they feared an immediate risk to public health. The takeaway reopened several months later and further checks were carried out by the council to ensure the infestation was under control. But it was closed down in May for good by the owner. Infestation: Mouse droppings could be seen all over the floor at the now closed Pizza Plus Fried Chicken.

"Mario Balotelli moved a step closer to an Anfield exit in the summer as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed that the Italian had withdrawn himself from the squad to travel to Arsenal after taking a ‘slight knock’ in training. The £16million striker would only have been a substitute against Arsenal and would even have been behind Daniel Sturridge, who also started on the bench, in the pecking order. And Rodgers revealed the striker did not travel with the squad after a sustaining training ground injury on Friday. Mario Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal after picking up a slight knock. Brendan Rodgers revealed that Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad and did not travel to London. ‘He trained on Friday afternoon with the team and he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed himself not able to travel,’ said Rodgers. ‘I’m not a medic. He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it. It was just something that he himself didn’t feel comfortable enough to travel.’ Arsenal ran out 4-1 winners against Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday. Mesut Ozil scored Arsenal's second as Hector Bellerin, Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud also netted. Though Rodgers did not question Balotelli’s commitment to the club’s cause, the player has been a constant source of frustration at the club this season, with the manager having previously made it clear that he would have to work much harder to adapt to Liverpool’s style. With just four goals in 25 appearances, his future at the club is already in question – though he has another three years on his contract.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Mario Balotelli moved a step closer to an Anfield exit in the summer as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed that the Italian had withdrawn himself from the squad to travel to Arsenal after taking a ‘slight knock’ in training.

"Some tour guides will do anything for a good tip. In the Australian outback, if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local Emus, you need a guide who will get down and dirty ... apparently. In a video posted online by YouTube user Ratbag Nomad, one man, referred to as Australianwidefishingguide, shows tourists how it's done. Emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of Australia. As the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air, the mob of emus started coming closer. And closer. The video, filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush, shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance. Peddling his legs to the sky, he looks like something between  an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach. Sure enough, the Emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what's going on, then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat. A good leg in the air does the trick. As the guide leapt to his feet, the inquisitive birds scattered. It's thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - whose meat was highly valued for its oils. Emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary. Capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km/hour, they're said to be able to 'run the pants off a Kangaroo.'

'As a young player you make mistakes but I know Raheem very well and have seen him develop as a young man and we aim to carry on that development. 'He is a very strong character and there was never any thought I would leave him out.' Sterling did suggest he is considering his future at the club during a BBC interview last week. But Rodgers claims he is still focused on playing for Liverpool during the remainder of the season.' Provide only the summary as the response.",e5895596857c454fb418d6b1948be797
"Twin 18-month-old boys were pronounced dead at a hospital after being pulled from a canal in Arizona. The toddlers are believed to have fallen in the water accidentally at 9.45am on Friday in Yuma, Arizona. After a police search that lasted more than an hour, the brothers were pulled from the water. They were flown by a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter to a Yuma hospital, where they were pronounced dead, Franklin said. Tragic: Twin 18-month-old boys died after accidentally falling in a canal in Arizona on Friday morning. Detectives investigating the case believe the boys ended up in the canal by accident and don't suspect foul play, Franklin said.

Bush, 90, fell ill in December and was hospitalized after complaining of shortness of breath. Smiling and enjoying the fresh air, he seemed to be in better spirits. Bush is a fan of Associated Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour 250 events and lives in the Houston Area with his wife Barbara. He and his wife have attended many ATP fundraisers and charity events throughout the years. In good spirits!: Former President George H.W. Bush, seated, arrives just before the quarterfinal match between Jeremy Chardy of France and Kevin Anderson from South Africa was suspended by rain. Roy Emerson, 78, who owns 28 major singles and doubles championships, is also a big fan and makes an annual appearance at the tournament. Both Bush and Emerson enjoyed watching  Kevin Anderson of South Africa battle Jeremy Chardy of France before heavy rains postponed the game. Bush looked in far better shape than he did late last year and three years prior when he was also hospitalized. Bush spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. He was discharged in January 2013, after nearly two months in the hospital. Bush is the oldest living former American president.

Speaking after the game, Carlo Ancelotti said: 'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty. 'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' That appeal has now been successful and Ronaldo - who netted his 300th goal for the club in Wednesday's win - will be part of Los Blancos' starting XI against Eibar. Real currently sit second in the table but they will be looking to close the gap on leaders Barcelona, who face a tough trip to fifth-placed Sevilla on Saturday evening.

'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' That appeal has now been successful and Ronaldo - who netted his 300th goal for the club in Wednesday's win - will be part of Los Blancos' starting XI against Eibar. Real currently sit second in the table but they will be looking to close the gap on leaders Barcelona, who face a tough trip to fifth-placed Sevilla on Saturday evening.

"It appears that David Luiz has taken the phrase 'twiddling my hair' literally judging by the injured Paris Saint-Germain star's latest Instagram post.

And it seems that boredom has already kicked into the usually jovial Brazilian as he sported a new hairdo on Wednesday. David Luiz posted an Instagram picture sporting a new hairdo in the style of a man bun on Wednesday.

The centre back's new look seems to be a source of amusement for his PSG team-mate Lucas Moura who later shared a picture with Luiz among his Instagram followers.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has heaped praise upon Loic Remy after the striker scored his second consecutive winner in the 2-1 victory over Stoke on Saturday. Remy's goal meant Mourinho's side took another step towards securing the Premier League title with  three points, despite an injury to Diego Costa. Costa hobbled off 10 minutes after replacing Oscar at half-time, with another hamstring problem leaving him set for a spell on the sidelines. Remy scored Chelsea's winner against Stoke in the game at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Remy's importance to Chelsea could grow as Diego Costa left the Stoke game injured. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho praised the professionalism and scoring ability of Remy. But Mourinho refused to let the injury dampen the significance of the win, instead lauding Remy's scoring instincts after the forward also netted the decisive strike when Chelsea beat Hull 3-2 in their last game before the international break. 'When Eden (Hazard) recovered the ball from a loose throw from Asmir Begovic, you could see immediately Remy sprinted to score what I call an easy goal, but I love strikers to score easy goals,' Mourinho said. 'The tap-in when the goalkeeper has an incomplete save, attacking the ball on a low cross, rebounds - I love the easy goals from a striker. Remy (centre) also netted Chelsea's winner against Hull before the international break. Mourinho said Remy has already made a crucial contribution to Chelsea despite not playing too often. 'Remy keeps himself in great condition, even without having played many minutes, to be ready for us. 'He's a great boy and his contribution is already crucial, with these two match-winners in the last two matches.'","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has heaped praise upon Loic Remy after the striker scored his second consecutive winner in the 2-1 victory over Stoke on Saturday.

"Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood will move for Chris Ramsey if the Queens Park Rangers manager leaves the London club this summer. The pair forged a close bond during their time together at Tottenham and Sherwood is keen to rekindle their working relationship at Villa Park. Ramsey took over as QPR manager until the end of the season following the departure of Harry Redknapp in February. TIm Sherwood could move to get Chris Ramsey on his coaching staff if he leaves QPR in the summer. Queens Park Rangers manager  Ramsey has lost six games out of seven in charge of the London club. Sherwood also revealed that he wishes he had striker Darren Bent (centre) at his disposal. But his position is far from certain, losing six out of his seven games in charge. However, he will be handed an instant route back into football should he lose his job at Loftus Road. Sherwood rates Ramsey as one of this country’s best coaches and will find a senior role for the 52-year-old should he depart QPR. Sherwood also wishes Darren Bent was still at Villa for the season climax and will explore keeping the striker at the club when his contract expires this summer.

"Forget football and females and other traditional pub banter - modern men are more likely to chat about their children over a pint with their friends. Relationship issues and sexual problems are also high on the agenda for discussion down the boozer. Those were the findings of more than 70 hours of footage from hidden cameras in one London pub. Session: Secret cameras at an east London boozer showed that men are more likely to discuss sexual problems and relationship issues than the weekend's football matches. They didn't pick up a single mention of football, while women were discussed only occasionally. One man in the Lord Nelson pub was heard telling his friends how he realised he was gay while dating a married woman. Three middle-aged men talked openly about erectile dysfunction and another spoke about his fears about having a kidney transplant. Secret Life of the Pub: Recordings showed how one man openly talked about erectile dysfunction. Catch up: The cameras revealed how the modern man feels happy to discuss sexual and relationship issues. Another customer at the pub on the Isle of Dogs, which attracts drinkers from all walks of life, including professionals from nearby Canary Wharf, told his companions the lack of affection shown to him by his parents means he values their friendship all the more.

"Jose Mourinho has thickened up his Chelsea midfield for Sunday's west London derby at QPR. The Chelsea manager has been trialling a formation with Ramires and Nemanja Matic in front of the back four as the league leaders head to Loftus Road. Mourinho has stuck with the team that it is likely to mean a more advanced role for Cesc Fabregas in the 'No10' position behind Didier Drogba up front, with fellow striker Loic Remy out injured. Brazilian midfielder Oscar has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea's last 11 games. Eden Hazard, who Mourinho believes is the only realistic candidate to be named PFA player of the year, starts on the left. Willian will start on the right and his Brazilian team-mate Oscar may drop out of the starting line up for the clash at QPR.

"It has long been a highlight of the racing calender - and the ladies of Liverpool certainly didn't disappoint  with fashion and drunken frolics once again taking centre stage. Trotting into Aintree in a collection of floral, flamboyant and eye-catching numbers, thousands of female race-goers displayed their indomitable spirit for the occasion. Clearly taking the 'Chanel-inspired' style guide to heart, many opted for outfits that wouldn't have been out of place at a wedding - whether as part of the bridal party or as the bride herself. Others seemed to have taken heed of the sunshine and instead sported full-skirted looks bedecked with blooms in pastel shades of lemon, periwinkle and peach. Most, however, were intent on nothing more than enjoying the blissful weather with many opening proceedings with a mini bottle of champagne, quaffed with the help of a booze funnel. The occasion may have commenced with glamorous group photos and sunny selfies but as Ladies' Day rolled on, the hours of drinking appeared to take their toll, not only on the female race fans but their outfits as well. Wardrobe malfunctions hit many a low-cut dress and thigh-length frock and some even chose to flash their bottom for photographers, while others struggled to keep their composure on a wooden racehorse. As the mid-afternoon sun beamed over Aintree, balancing in high heels and platforms presented more of a challenge and race-goers were seen staggering around the grounds. It wasn't just the ladies who were making the most of the occasion. Aintree's gentlemen were also out in full force, with one group donning a particularly garish selection of suits.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'It has long been a highlight of the racing calender - and the ladies of Liverpool certainly didn't disappoint  with fashion and drunken frolics once again taking centre stage.

Pentagon officials have slammed the move as 'unprofessional' and 'unsafe'. A Russian jet 'aggressively' intercepted a U.S. RC-135U plane (pictured) over Poland, the Pentagon claims. Spokesman Mark Wright told CNN the Russian jet performed 'aggressive maneuvers' at high speed in close proximity to the plane. He added that the State Department will consequently be filing a complaint to Russia 'through diplomatic channels'. Russia has rubbished claims it was a deliberate and aggressive interception.

The reigning champions have shelled out for six coaches to transport around 3,000 people to Selhurst Park, notoriously one of the most difficult top flight grounds for Northern club fans to reach. The move was made after TV scheduling for the 8pm kick-off made it virtually impossible for supporters to return home by either train or plane on the same night. David Silva (right) celebrates scoring in City's 3-0 defeat of Crystal Palace earlier this season. Around 300 City fans have been afforded free travel on six coaches to take them to Selhurst Park. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of football fans are facing a travel nightmare this weekend because of the Easter rail shut down. Despite more than 30 Premiership and Championship games scheduled for the long weekend, large parts of the rail network are set to be closed for repair works. More than half the games are set to be affected by delays and disruption, forcing fans onto the roads. Many grounds will not reach full capacity over Easter as rail closures disrupt travel plans. Labour has accused the Government of failing to learn from the Boxing Day chaos, when nearly a million football fans faced nightmare journeys to follow their team. Ministers were warned of the potential problems in advance Labour has claimed – but they failed to scrutinise the planned level of maintenance work. Every single major artery on Britain's railways was shut down. No trains ran between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western mainlines.

Pietersen returned to nets at Surrey on Monday and left The Oval after training finished just before 2pm. Pietersen was pictured driving away from The Oval in his expensive Telsa sports car. Pietersen managed a wry smile as he drove away after training on Monday afternoon. Pietersen was later pictured leaving the ground just before 2pm and is expected to step-up his county rehabilitation with  a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12. Ultimately, Pietersen is hoping to impress enough for Surrey to earn a re-call to the England side - possibly for this summer's Ashes rematch - having been sacked by the national side in 2014. England left for the West Indies for their upcoming Test series on Thursday, with coach Peter Moores leaving KP in no doubt that he still has a lot to prove - despite incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves appearing to extended an olive branch to the exiled batsman.

Pietersen was later pictured leaving the ground just before 2pm and is expected to step-up his county rehabilitation with  a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12. Ultimately, Pietersen is hoping to impress enough for Surrey to earn a re-call to the England side - possibly for this summer's Ashes rematch - having been sacked by the national side in 2014. England left for the West Indies for their upcoming Test series on Thursday, with coach Peter Moores leaving KP in no doubt that he still has a lot to prove - despite incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves appearing to extended an olive branch to the exiled batsman. Asked at Gatwick about Pietersen's situation, Moores said: 'From my point of view, Kevin isn't on the radar.'' Provide only the summary as the response.",31e7e9de4ebd4f38ade6d2554b97294a

"Daredevil Nik Wallenda says he'll walk untethered on top of a 400-foot observation wheel in Orlando, Florida, this month. Wallenda said Monday at a New York City news conference that the Orlando Eye will be moving when he attempts his feat April 29. The Orlando Eye, part of a new entertainment complex, will offer views of central Florida from inside 30 enclosed, air-conditioned glass capsules when it opens to the public on May 4. Scroll down for video. Eyes on the prize: High-wire performer Nik Wallenda announces his latest stunt at the 400-foot Orlando Eye, during a news conference, in New York on Monday. Tough challenge: The 36-year-old daredevil will walk atop the Orlando Eye as it turns on April 29. The Orlando Eye team issued a statement saying it's excited to have Wallenda attempt the 'amazing stunt.' No distance for the performance has been set yet, but Wallenda, 36, said he was not likely to walk the entire 20 minutes or so that it takes the wheel to go a full circle. Wallenda previously walked atop a Ferris wheel in Santa Cruz, California, but he said the size of the much larger Orlando wheel and the fact that he will not use a pole sets this stunt apart. The seventh-generation member of the 'Flying Wallenda' family of acrobats has walked across the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. In November, he walked twice between two Chicago skyscrapers without a net or harness, doing the second walk blindfolded. Wallenda is the great-grandson of Karl Wallenda, who fell to his death in Puerto Rico at 73.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Daredevil Nik Wallenda says he'll walk untethered on top of a 400-foot observation wheel in Orlando, Florida, this month.

"Chelsea could move for Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda in the summer. The club's technical director Michael Emenalo travelled to Spain on Saturday to watch the defender during Atletico's 2-2 draw with Malaga, according to Spanish newspaper AS. The 31-year-old has one year left on his contract and Atletico are reportedly keen to cash in this summer. Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda (left) competes for the ball with Real Sociedad's Mikel Gonzalez. Miranda has also been offered to Manchester United and Manchester City, but both clubs are more interested in the Brazilian's team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez. Chelsea and Atletico held talks over Miranda last summer when Jose Mourinho's side moved to sign Diego Costa and Felipe Luis, but the defender rejected a move to London – as well as United – to remain in Madrid. But the presence of Costa and Luis at Stamford Bridge coupled with the emergence of Gimenez as a regular at Atletico may convince Miranda to join Chelsea this time around. Miranda currently has a year left on his contract and has yet to agree a new deal with the Spanish side. Earlier in the month, however, Miranda rejected talk that he would leave Atletico. Asked about speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford, Miranda told Brazilian website Estadao: 'Of course this news reaches me, and it makes me happy. It shows I am doing well. 'It makes me proud, but my intention is to stay at Atletico because I still have a year and a half on my contract.' The emergence of defender Jose Maria Gimenez at Atletico may influence Miranda's decision this summer.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Chelsea could move for Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda in the summer.

The 31-year-old has one year left on his contract and Atletico are reportedly keen to cash in this summer. Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda (left) competes for the ball with Real Sociedad's Mikel Gonzalez. Miranda has also been offered to Manchester United and Manchester City, but both clubs are more interested in the Brazilian's team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez. Chelsea and Atletico held talks over Miranda last summer when Jose Mourinho's side moved to sign Diego Costa and Felipe Luis, but the defender rejected a move to London – as well as United – to remain in Madrid. But the presence of Costa and Luis at Stamford Bridge coupled with the emergence of Gimenez as a regular at Atletico may convince Miranda to join Chelsea this time around. Miranda currently has a year left on his contract and has yet to agree a new deal with the Spanish side. Earlier in the month, however, Miranda rejected talk that he would leave Atletico. Asked about speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford, Miranda told Brazilian website Estadao: 'Of course this news reaches me, and it makes me happy. It shows I am doing well. 'It makes me proud, but my intention is to stay at Atletico because I still have a year and a half on my contract.' The emergence of defender Jose Maria Gimenez at Atletico may influence Miranda's decision this summer.' Provide only the summary as the response.",611315613c144e708d43498651fa7ff3

But while they may not be able to vote for themselves, James seems to think his influence with the Cavaliers deserves recognition. LeBron James seems to have decided who deserves the NBA MVP award at the end of the season. LeBron goes up for a slam dunk (left) during the victory against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. When asked  who would his vote be for MVP this year by ESPN, James replied 'myself', before adding: 'Guys are going to be able to recognise the guys they play against every night and what they do for their franchises.' James may be trailing New Orleans' Anthony Davis and Oklahoma City’s Russell Westbrook, but has impressed on his return to Cleveland. In the four years that he was playing for Miami Heat, the Cavs won 19, 21, 24 and 33 games; they have already won 51 games this season, and secured the Central Division title and No 2 seed in the Eastern Conference by defeating Milwaukee. James scored 21 points with nine rebounds and eight assists for the Cavs in their 104-99 victory against the Bucks, including 10 points in the fourth quarter.

Kondogbia celebrates after scoring against Arsenal in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 clash. Kondogbia pictured in action for France against Denmark during the recent international break. He had an initial dip in form after his move but has since kicked on again and has impressed Liverpool scouts in Europe and the French league this season. The 22-year-old was key to Monaco's Champions League victory over Arsenal, particularly in their first leg performance at The Emirates and is back on the radar of other big clubs. Kondogbia has represented France three times and has made 23 appearances for Monaco this season. Liverpool remain keen on bringing Danny Ings, whose contract expires in the summer, to Anfield from Burnley.

His participation on Wednesday is in doubt,' the club said. Bastian Schweinsteiger suffered an ankle injury during Bayern Munich's weekend win over Dortmund. Schweinsteiger will miss Bayern's German Cup quarter-final against Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday. Bayern said that Schweinsteiger's injury wasn't serious but he will miss the Cup tie on Wednesday. The Germany captain missed the opening four months of the season with a knee injury, only making his first start in December. Bayern, chasing a repeat of their 2013 treble-winning season, saw their injury list grow even longer on Monday with reserve goalkeeper Tom Starke ruled out for four weeks after suffering an ankle ligament tear in training. Bayern's players celebrate in front of their fans at Signal Iduna Park after their 1-0 win. Robert Lewandowski heads home the winner against his former club on Saturday night. The Bavarians, top of the league and through to the Champions League last eight where they face Porto later this month, are already without top scorer Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Holger Badstuber and Franck Ribery. Ribery, on his way back from an ankle injury, also missed training on Monday.' Provide only the summary as the response.",1302e9322a3a44ff999ffb0f47fc19f7
"Jeremy Peace, the West Bromwich Albion chairman, will only sell the club to a buyer who will invest money on and off the pitch. Tony Pulis has held conversations with Peace and is adamant the chairman wants to ensure his legacy is maintained. Peace is open to selling West Brom for £150million as long as a suitable custodian can be found by July, and Pulis would want immediate talks with any new chairman over his position.

"Barcelona's Brazilian star Neymar was left fuming after being substituted by Luis Enrique during the 2-2 draw at Sevilla on Saturday night, according to reports in Spain. Neymar, who scored his side's second goal with a curling free kick, was replaced with the score at 2-1 and 15 minutes to play. Sevilla then scored a late equaliser, and Neymar 'can't understand why he is subbed so much' reports Spanish paper Sport. Neymar's dispute with Luis Enrique features prominently in Spain, while they look ahead to the Madrid derby. The paper points out that the forward has been replaced in 15 of his 34 matches this season, with only Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta being substituted more. With Barcelona still top of La Liga, and challenging for a treble, the paper points out that the club will need to be united in the final run-in. Elsewhere in Spain the attention is focused on the Madrid derby in this week's Champions League quarter-finals. Marca claims that the game is 'like a final', with the two teams playing out a repeat of last year's showdown in Lisbon, while in AS, Real defender Pepe calls for intensity and humility. In Italy the headlines are dominated by Lazio, who moved above their city rivals Roma into second place in Serie A with a win over Empoli.

"We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars. This week: Jennifer Aniston's arms. Jennifer looking toned at the 2015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party hosted by Graydon Carter. In a Versace gown at this year's Oscars, Jennifer Aniston showed off her well-toned arms. The 46-year-old works out three times a week with her long-term trainer, Mandy Ingber. Sessions include 20-25 minutes of spinning, followed by 45 minutes of yoga. On other days, she might do anything from 40 minutes cycling to ten minutes each of core work, spinning and running. When she stays at a hotel, Aniston takes 3.6kg weights with her. She says exercise, plus meditation, is her 'ultimate stress reliever'. Her PT sessions include 20-25 minutes of spinning, followed by 45 minutes of yoga. What to try:. The medicine ball overhead press is great for upper arms. Ideally, use a weighted medicine ball, but a football is fine for beginners. Hold the ball in both hands above your head, arms extended straight but elbows not locked. Keeping arms vertical, lower the ball behind you by bending the elbows. Go as far as 90 degrees, then straighten the arms. Repeat 12-15 times and do two sets.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'We reveal how to get the enviable physiques of the stars. This week: Jennifer Aniston's arms.

"Scottish comedian Limmy has horrified fans by posting a video of a massive spider crawling out of his mouth and inching its way across his face. The 38-year-old, who starred in the BBC comedy Limmy's Show, revolted his many followers after he uploaded the seven-second clip. During the clip, Limmy keeps a manic grin on his face as the spider walks out of his mouth and along his cheek. Comedian Limmy grins manically as the three-inch house spider crawls out of his mouth onto his chin. In what has been described as a self-imposed 'bushtucker trial' Limmy commented 'Sweet dreams' to his fans. The three-inch house spider appears to be completely unharmed by its ordeal in the Glaswegian's mouth. One fan called Toxxi asked: 'How does it know not to just go down your throat and get killed in an oesophagus spasm?' Umar Ditta queried: 'How many have you eaten?' Annie MacDonald replied: 'Oh man. It’s disgusting.' And David Morgan added: 'Let the nightmares begin.' Others were more impressed by Limmy’s vine. Marina insisted: 'This is the best thing I’ve ever seen.' And someone called TheEventHorizon wrote: 'This truly is the best clip the internet has ever generated. Well done Limmy mate.' The spider runs down across Limmy's chin before making its way up along the side of his left cheek.

"Jonathan Trott's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful, as he was caught at first slip just three balls in. Trott last played a Test for his country in November 2013, when he withdrew from England's disastrous Ashes tour with a stress-related illness. But his much-anticipated return, this time as captain Alastair Cook's opening partner, was over almost before it had begun when he nicked Jerome Taylor to Darren Bravo. Jonathan Trott trudges off the field after being dismissed for a duck in his first game back in the Test team. Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott in the first over as England slumped to 1-1 after just five balls. Trott, usually a middle order batsman, had been preferred to Yorkshire's Adam Lyth, still to make his England debut, and moved up to the top of the order. But the gamble failed for the Warwickshire man, who has worked hard to prove he still has the quality to play Test cricket since his Ashes withdrawal the winter before last. The wicket left England one for one after just five balls after being put into bat by the West Indies in the first Test in Antigua. Trott was making his first Test appearance since his Ashes turmoil against Mitchell Johnson 18 months ago.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Jonathan Trott's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful, as he was caught at first slip just three balls in.

But his much-anticipated return, this time as captain Alastair Cook's opening partner, was over almost before it had begun when he nicked Jerome Taylor to Darren Bravo. Jonathan Trott trudges off the field after being dismissed for a duck in his first game back in the Test team. Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott in the first over as England slumped to 1-1 after just five balls. Trott, usually a middle order batsman, had been preferred to Yorkshire's Adam Lyth, still to make his England debut, and moved up to the top of the order. But the gamble failed for the Warwickshire man, who has worked hard to prove he still has the quality to play Test cricket since his Ashes withdrawal the winter before last. The wicket left England one for one after just five balls after being put into bat by the West Indies in the first Test in Antigua. Trott was making his first Test appearance since his Ashes turmoil against Mitchell Johnson 18 months ago.' Provide only the summary as the response.",e5e93c5beda14dfb8c8e8a94b45ab86b

Karabatic's lawyer Michael Corbier told Sportsmail on Wednesday the trial will likely take place within months. French handball star Nikola Karabatic has been accused of match fixing along with 15 others. Former Montpellier ace competes for France in Handball World Cup match against Iceland in January.

The college student spotted the car on the streets of Mississauga, Canada, last autumn and  began following in his own vehicle. His plan? To get the all important 'selfie' - and make an appearance on the Street View map. 'Time to shine': Nasr Bitar saw taking the perfect selfie with Google Street View as a chance to 'shine' Tracked: It was the first time Nasr had seen a Street View car, and he followed it in his own vehicle. Having figured out the pattern the Street View car was following, Nasr parked his car, jumped out and got in position - just in time to take the snap. He told PetaPixel.com: 'I was driving home when I saw the Google car drive towards me. 'I had never seen one before, and it took me a few minutes to realize that it is Google car and it was time to shine.' But then came the wait to see if he would make it onto the site. So, imagine Nasr's delight when he realised Street View had been updated - and he could be seen proudly taking his selfie. Ready to go: The car clearly captured Nasr waiting to take the all-important selfie in Mississauga, Canada. Viral: The image of his selfie, and the Street View shot, has now been shared almost 2.9million times. He then uploaded the picture to his Instagram account - where he describes himself as 'a tourist of the world', with the hashtag 'DontYouWishYouHadMyLife'. It was then uploaded to image sharing website imgur, and has now been viewed almost 2.9million times since it was posted two days ago.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'For most people, spotting a Google Street View car is an interesting, if uneventful, point in the day.

And Ibe took to Instagram, to show off his ability to perform the dance move, that many people around the country wish they could replicate.

He did not attend a brief hearing at Trafford Magistrates' Court on Wednesday but a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf by his lawyer, meaning he will now stand trial over the incident.

"Japan's J-League is just four games into a new season, but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent's face. Videos of the South Korean defender Kim Min Hyeok, who plays for Sagan Tosu, have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent Mu Kanazaki. Sagan are ninth in the J-League and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed Kashima Antlers player Kanazaki. Kim Min Hyeok (left) and Mu Kanazaki (right) fight it out for the ball on the wing during a J-League clash. After Kanazaki went down, it is alleged that Hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent. Despite the vicious looking nature of Hyeok’s apparent attack and Kanazaki’s dramatic clutch to his face, the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on, much to the fans' uproar. Whether or not the foul was intentional, it is suspected that the reason for Japanese  fans’ outcry is not so much the act itself, but the fact that it was committed by a South Korean player. Hyeok's boot appears to scrape down Kanazaki's face, but the man on the floor came out as the winner later. Hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium. Some Japanese fans have demanded not only the expulsion of Hyeok, but of all South Koreans, from the game. However, regardless of the controversy, justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on player’s team won 3-1, with Kanazaki among the goals.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Japan's J-League is just four games into a new season, but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent's face.

Amy Kight, Busch Wildlife Sanctuary's Animal Care Director, told WPTV: 'My first reaction was amazement that somebody actually took that picture because bobcats are generally very, very reclusive. 'You don't really see them out and about too often.' A spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has said she believes the image is genuine. FWC's Liz Barraco told WESH 'There is no reason to believe it's fake.' The bobcat exhibited typical behavior, FWC officials told the NBC affiliate station.

"Money will not play a major part in Pep Guardiola's contract discussions with Bayern Munich, according to board member Jan-Christian Dreesen. The former Barcelona boss, who led Bayern to the Bundesliga title and German Cup in his first season in charge, has a contract which expires in the summer of 2016. Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge revealed earlier this year that negotiations over a new deal will take place this summer as Bayern look to extend Guardiola's stay at the Allianz Arena. Pep Guardiola is set to enter into contract negotiations with Bayern Munich at the end of the season. Bayern Munich's players celebrate after beating rivals Borussia Dortmund 1-0 on Saturday. The Spaniard has been linked strongly with Manchester City in the past but Dreesen believes Guardiola will not base his decision on where he will earn the most money. Speaking to Sport Bild, Dreesen said: 'Pep is not the type of coach who is trying to make as much money as possible. 'He could already have made much more money elsewhere when he joined Bayern.' Bayern are currently 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and face Bayer Leverkusen in the quarter-finals of the German Cup on Wednesday night. They also face a two-legged tie against Porto in the last eight of the Champions League. Robert Lewandowski heads home the only goal against Dortmund as Bayern maintain their 10-point advantage.

"Manchester City's FA Cup-winning goalkeeper, Harry Dowd, has died, aged 76. Dowd, a member of the side who beat Leicester City 1-0 at Wembley in 1969, played 181 games in nine years at Maine Road. The Salford-born keeper once famously scored for City, against Bury, after switching to centre forward in a game in 1964, having broken his thumb. Harry Dowd (third from right) celebrates after Manchester City win the FA Cup at Wembley in 1969. He joined the club as an amateur at the age of 20 in 1958 and carried on working as a plumber after turning professional two years later. Former City player Fred Eyre paid tribute to Dowd, praising the popular stopper. 'Harry was one of the most popular at the club, we all used to love Harry,' said Eyre. 'He was a great goalkeeper.' 'When we had training he would come over and train with the team, and then afterwards he would go straight back to work.' Dowd was succeeded at City by Joe Corrigan but continued playing at Stoke City before ending his career at Oldham Athletic in 1974.

Ander Herrera races away to celebrate after he scored his second goal against Aston Villa on Saturday.

Ander Herrera posted his picture on his Instagram with his Manchester United team-mate Juan Mata (left) Herrera followed up his compatriot's achievement with a brace of his own as United stormed to a 3-1 victory against Aston Villa on Saturday. That win lifted United above bitter rivals Manchester City to third in the Premier League table with the two sides set to clash in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday.

"An attacker got more than he bargained for - when his chosen victim floored him twice with her martial arts skills after he tried to rape her. The unidentified restaurant owner was attacked by the would-be rapist as she was closing the empty shop in the eastern province of Shandong, China. She let the man into the eatery when he knocked on the door and asked to use the toilet, The People's Daily reported. The restaurant owner used her martial arts skills to overpower the would-be rapist and pin him to the ground. The unidentified woman then raced out of the restaurant - but was followed by her attacker. The man tried to grab her - but had a shock of his own when she used her self-defence skills to overpower him. CCTV images from inside the restaurant show how the woman, who was wearing a mini-skirt and heels, pinned her attacker to the floor and put her hands around his throat - warning him to leave her alone. She then fled the restaurant but he tried to attack her again - only for the intrepid restaurateur to knock him down outside the eatery and escape unharmed. The entire, extraordinary drama was captured on security cameras inside and outside the restaurant, which police used to trace the man.

Ernest Goult, 72, is accused of making the gesture at a Middlesbrough home game against Blackburn in the Championship in November. Blackburn players Markus Olsson, Rudy Gestede and Lee Williamson are expected to give evidence at the trial about the alleged incident at the Riverside Stadium. Pensioner Ernest Goult arrives at court, where he will stand trial for allegedly making a racist gesture. Teesside Magistrates' Court heard a police officer would also be giving evidence and the prosecution would produce CCTV footage.

The home team had been leading the game 1-0 until Gestede scored a controversial equaliser deep into stoppage time. Rudy Gestede celebrates his stoppage-time goal that levelled the game, which was played in November.

Stepping up to the tee on the 130-yard fourth, the greatest golfer of all time saw his shot sail beyond the flag before spinning back into the hole. Jack Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with a hole in one on the fourth during the Par-3 Contest. Nicklaus holds up his ball to an adoring crowd as Gary Player (left) and Ben Crenshaw salute the great. Crenshaw and Nicklaus fist pump following his ace on the 130-yard hole at Augusta National. Nicklaus was playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw  as the first roar of Masters week filled the skies in a sunswept Georgia. 'I had an interview this morning, and I said ""well, all I've got to do is go out and win the Par-3 and make a hole and one"", and I make a hole in one,' Nicklaus said afterwards. The ace was Nicklaus' first on the hallowed turf of Augusta, but the veteran saw his achievement eclipsed by that of Camilo Villegas on a day which saw five hole-in-ones, levelling the record from 2002. The Colombian followed Nicklaus with an ace on the fourth and also managed one on the eighth, but he couldn't quite land the title, losing out to world No 74 Kevin Streelman in a play-off. Nicklaus became the youngest person to wear a green jacket in 1963, and collected his sixth in 1986. He is one of five men to complete the career grand slam, an accolade which favourite Rory McIlroy can achieve if he wins his third major in succession.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'At the grand old age of 75, Jack Nicklaus is still capable of hitting aces.

"Second-half goals by Mohamed Yattara and Alexandre Lacazette helped Olympique Lyonnais go top of Ligue 1 with a 2-0 home win against Bastia on Wednesday. Substitute Yattara opened the scoring in the 77th minute and Ligue 1 top scorer Lacazette took his tally to 25 eight minutes later to move Lyon up to 64 points from 32 games. French champions Paris Saint-Germain, who have one game in hand, are second two points off the pace. Alexandre Lacazette and Mohamed Yattara were both on the score sheet as Lyon beat Bastia. Guinean striker Yattara opens the scoring against Bastia on Wednesday at the Stade de Gerland. Lyon dominated throughout but were made to wait by Bastia, who were reeling from their 4-0 defeat in the League Cup final against PSG last Saturday. Lyon's Jordan Ferri dribbled past a defender before his curling shot was superbly saved by Alphonse Areola in the sixth minute. Areola was at it again when he blocked Steed Malbranque's back heel on the half hour and tipped away Clinton Njie's low shot three minutes before the break as Lyon continued to dominate. Lacazette seals victory and top spot in the French Ligue 1 for Lyon in the second half. Frenchman Lacazette is the top scorer in Ligue 1 this season with 25 goals to his name.

"A magnitude 3.1 earthquake caused a sharp jolt to be felt across a well-populated area just north of Los Angeles. The US Geological Survey said in a preliminary report that the quake with a depth of about five miles happened just before 9pm last night, according to the Associated Press. It was centered about four miles north of San Fernando near Interstate 210. The epicentre of the quake was around four miles north of San Fernando near Interstate 210, according to the US Geological Survey. The earthquake caused a 'sharp jolt' to be felt in the San Fernando Valley (pictured) north of Los Angeles. The jolt was felt widely in the San Fernando Valley and parts of northern Los Angeles County. There was no reported damage or injuries and police and fire departments say there were no problems reported. The quake came three days after a magnitude 3.5 earthquake hit the west Los Angeles neighborhood of Baldwin Hills. It happened around 9.17pm and reverberated across the city. Residents on social media described it as a 'quick jolt'. Earlier in the day at 4.35pm a smaller 2.5 magnitude quake hit the same area. That quake was initially reported as a 2.9 magnitude tremor, but was later downgraded by the US Geological Survey. There were no reports of injuries or damages from either incident. Los Angelenos are used to such small tremors, due to the city's positioning on several fault lines.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A magnitude 3.1 earthquake caused a sharp jolt to be felt across a well-populated area just north of Los Angeles.

The young Spanish defender made his hoop dreams come true by netting a lofted pass from around 30 yards 'downtown' straight into a basketball ring on the other side of the club's Ciutat Esportiva training ground. After the ball drops into the net, a group of watching players applaud while others, including Ivan Rakitic and Javier Mascherano, race over to congratulate the 23-year-old left-back. Martin Montoya (centre) lines up a lofted pass during the training session at Ciutat Esportiva. The ball sails high in the air seemingly in the direction of no one while players look on. Incredibly, the ball sinks directly into a basketball hoop at the other side of the training pitch. The young Spanish defender gives a thumbs up as Javier Mascherano (right) looks on open mouthed.

The young Spanish defender made his hoop dreams come true by netting a lofted pass from around 30 yards 'downtown' straight into a basketball ring on the other side of the club's Ciutat Esportiva training ground. After the ball drops into the net, a group of watching players applaud while others, including Ivan Rakitic and Javier Mascherano, race over to congratulate the 23-year-old left-back. Martin Montoya (centre) lines up a lofted pass during the training session at Ciutat Esportiva. The ball sails high in the air seemingly in the direction of no one while players look on. Incredibly, the ball sinks directly into a basketball hoop at the other side of the training pitch. The young Spanish defender gives a thumbs up as Javier Mascherano (right) looks on open mouthed. Meanwhile, Luis Enrique's side relentless march towards reclaiming the La Liga title moved another step closer on Wednesday evening following a 4-0 hammering of Almeria - with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez scoring the picks of the goals.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes he is improving in every aspect of his job but insisted his one problem is that he cannot help but be truthful when he addresses the media. The 52-year-old has won league titles in all four countries that he has managed - Portugal, England, Italy and Spain - and insists he continues to get better as a manager. But Mourinho regularly finds himself in hot water with the Football Association regarding his comments to the media. Jose Mourinho watches from the touchline during Chelsea's 2-1 win against Stoke last weekend. Mourinho believes he is getting better and better in every aspect of his job. The former Real Madrid manager was fined £25,000 earlier this season after claiming there was a clear campaign against his side after being riled by a number of refereeing decisions. He amassed a similar amount in FA fines last season after being charged for three separate incidents and Mourinho admits his frankness in front of the press is is one weakness. 'I think I have a problem, which is I'm getting better at everything related to my job since I started,' Mourinho told the Telegraph. Mourinho says his problem is that he is not a hypocrite when he faces the media. The Chelsea boss said there was 'a campaign' against his side after his side's game against Southampton. 'There has been evolution in many different areas – the way I read the game; the way I prepare the game; the way I train; the methodology… I feel better and better. 'But there is one point where I cannot change: when I face the media, I am never a hypocrite.'","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes he is improving in every aspect of his job but insisted his one problem is that he cannot help but be truthful when he addresses the media.

"Arsenal supremo Dick Law has flown to Argentina in an attempt to rubber-stamp the capture of Maxi Romero. The club's chief negotiator has jetted to South America to finalise a deal for the 16-year-old forward - who has been compared to Lionel Messi. The Gunners are in advanced talks with Velez Sarsfield over a £4.5million swoop for the teenage sensation. Arsenal are close to signing 16-year-old Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield for £4.5million. But the deal has been held up by red-tape over the make-up of Romero's ownership rights - and Law has travelled to Argentina to resolve the issues. Romero's agents and his club Velez both own stakes in the player, which is causing complications for Arsenal. The Premier League have strict rules regarding third-party ownership and the issue must be settled before he can play for the Gunners. Romero is expected to remain with Velez, on loan, for at least two more seasons before coming to England to begin his career with Arsenal. The youngster is yet to make his senior debut for Velez, but has trained regularly with the first team. The Argentine wonderkid has been dubbed the next Lionel Messi and would stay at Velez on loan.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Arsenal supremo Dick Law has flown to Argentina in an attempt to rubber-stamp the capture of Maxi Romero.

"Conceding three goals would be embarrassment enough for any goalkeeper, but Rob Green was forced to suffer even more humiliation at the hands of a ball boy on Monday night. As the clock ticked down during QPR's 3-3 away draw with Aston Villa, a cheeky youngster decided to while away a few more seconds by mugging off the former England No 1 with a handmade nutmeg. The ball boy, who initially shames himself by slipping over while retrieving the ball, toys with Green by pretending to hand him the ball back before rolling it between the clearly frustrated 35-year-old's legs. The Villa ball boy (front left) initially slips over while retrieving the ball behind QPR's goal. The Rangers No 1 smiles as he moves to retrieve the ball from the youngster during the 3-3 draw. The cheeky lad decides to embarrass the former England stopper by rolling the ball through his legs. The 35-year-old shows his frustration as the young prankster makes a swift exit. Green is no stranger to blooper reel moments, having let Clint Dempsey's shot slip through his fingers in the 1-1 draw with USA at the 2010 World Cup - a mistake that cost him his place at the tournament. Belgium powerhouse Christian Benteke ensured the points were shared at Villa Park by scoring a hat-trick against their his fellow relegation strugglers to move three points clear of the  safety zone. Having scored seven goals and taken four points from their last two games in a bid to beat relegation, Rangers host Premier League leaders Chelsea at Loftus Park on Sunday.

"Jenson Button has been penalised for his crash with Pastor Maldonado during Sunday’s Chinese Grand Prix. The pair were dicing for 13th place when Button hit the back of Maldonado’s Lotus as they battled for position on the run down to Turn 1. Maldonado, who earlier in his incident-packed race missed the entry to the pit-lane, was sent into a spin, while Button sustained damage to his front wing. Jenson Button crashed into the back of Pastor Maldonado's Lotus on lap 49 of the Chinese Grand Prix. The incident unfolded in front of Fernando Alonso (right) who moved up two places. While Button limped to finish 13th, Maldonado retired following rear-end damage sustained in the crash. The incident on lap 49 was referred to the race stewards and Button was given a five-second penalty after the race, which dropped the British driver to 14th. He was also given two penalty points on his superlicence. ‘I thought there was room on the inside and, yeah, I can't really say anything else’, said a downbeat Button. ‘An incident you never want to happen, but just a misjudgement I guess.’ Jenson Button appeared in a relaxed mood before Sunday's race but had an afternoon to forget in China. Button, who finished 13th before he was demoted, is lapped by the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. Button’s incident capped another disappointing weekend for McLaren with Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso scrapping for the menial places at the back of the field.

"Ben Stokes thought he had claimed his 23rd Test wicket when Jermaine Blackwood slashed his short delivery straight to Alastair Cook at slip. But the Durham all-rounder’s front foot had crossed the line and the batsman earned a reprieve. It’s not the first time this has happened to Stokes, of course — a similar error saw him denied his first Test wicket against Australia in Adelaide in 2013. Ben Stokes was denied the wicket of Jermaine Blackwood after overstepping the crease. Stokes overstepped the line when he thought he had England's fifth wicket of the day in Antigua. Stokes celebrated wildly when Brad Haddin was caught behind on that occasion, and the pair clashed when the decision was overturned. Michael Vaughan, while commentating on BBC’s Test Match Special, thinks the 23-year-old should return to his natural style of bowling. ‘Stokes is trying to be a very English-type bowler,’ Vaughan said. ‘But when I’ve seen him bowl really well, I’ve seen him bowl short spells: really fast, with lots of bouncers.’ England gather in celebration of Stokes' wicket, only for it to be overturned by the umpire. Vaughan’s BBC colleague, Jonathan Agnew, thinks England will rue Tuesday’s showing. ‘England will look back on today as a missed opportunity in terms of batting,’ he said. ‘They still have the advantage, they’ve kept chipping away with wickets and they’ve kept things very tight, but they could have done with that Blackwood wicket.’","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Ben Stokes thought he had claimed his 23rd Test wicket when Jermaine Blackwood slashed his short delivery straight to Alastair Cook at slip.

Cech, who joined Chelsea in 2004, has made just five Premier League appearances this season. Chelsea want at least £10million for Cech, and they would have to sell to a direct rival for the goalkeeper to end up at the Emirates. Prompted on TalkSport by Ray Parlour who said Arsenal 'have to get' Cech, Cudicini added: 'I agree. 'Arsenal have had a few problems with goalkeepers after [David] Seaman and [Jens] Lehmann. 'Szczesny is still struggling to impose himself as number one, so if a goalkeeper like Petr Cech is available in the summer, obviously he should be a big target for Arsenal.'

"A once in a lifetime shot, they said, but it appears Charlie Adam has done it before. The Stoke midfielder has been the talk of football this Easter weekend after his incredible 66-yard goal against Chelsea. Adam's sweetly struck left-footed strike gave goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois absolutely no chance. Scroll down to watch video of Charlie Adam scoring from the halfway line in 2009. Charlie Adam picks the ball up inside his own half during a reserve match against Accrington Stanley. Adam knocks the ball out in front of him before spotting the goalkeeper of his line and shooting. The Stanley keeper tries desperately to stop the ball as it sails towards the goal. The goalkeeper is left sprawled on the floor as the ball hits the back of the net. And that is not the first time the Scot has had a goalkeeper frantically back-pedalling before picking the ball out of his own net. Back in 2009, Adam scored a similar effort for Blackpool reserves against Accrington Stanley. He was in the opposition half this time though was out wide before hitting an effort that draws similarities with David Beckham's famous goal against Wimbledon in 1996. The stage, it has to be said, was far smaller too, though it's easy to see why Adam backed himself at Stamford Bridge on this evidence.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A once in a lifetime shot, they said, but it appears Charlie Adam has done it before.

"Derry Mathews' world title challenge is in limbo after Richar Abril withdrew for a second time.

"A southern Iowa chiropractor accused of accepting sex as payment for his services and performing exorcisms on patients has surrendered his state license. The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients.

"Giving away healthy lead is enough to send most managers into a fit of rage. There are many players out there that could vouch for that. On Saturday evening, NAC Breda manager Robert Maaskant let his fists do the talking as his side did just that against FC Dordrecht. After being two goals to the good at the interval thanks to goals from Dutch-Moroccan forward Adnane Tighadouini, relegation battlers NAC seemed to be heading towards three vital points against the team rooted to the bottom of the Eredivisie. NAC Breda manager Robert Maaskant takes out his anger on the substitutes bench on Saturday evening. After his side give up a two-goal lead the 46-year-old smashes through the plastic casing of the dugout. The livid NAC manager then turns to his bench to further express his dissatisfaction. However after the hour mark the home side appeared to crumble, letting the visitors claw themselves back into the game with two goals in as many minutes. Clearly incensed by his side's lack of concentration, Maaskant turned to his bench and threw a devastating right hook to the side of the dugout. The 46-year-old clearly packs a punch because his attack sent his fist clean through the plastic casing, cutting his hand. It goes without saying we wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of a Maaskant rant. It's lucky NAC's wobble didn't occur before they headed into the changing rooms at half time... with all those football boots lying around.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Giving away healthy lead is enough to send most managers into a fit of rage.

"British No 2 Aljaz Bedene was unable to sustain his strong run since switching allegiance from Slovenia, crashing out of the Grand Prix Hassan II in Casablanca in the last eight. The world No 99 had breezed past fellow-qualifier Arthur De Greef of Belgium in a 70-minute, straight-sets victory to set up his quarter-final clash - but was unable to dislodge Czech young gun Jiri Vesely on Friday. Vesely saw off Bedene 6-1 6-4 to reach the final four and tee up a clash with Spanish veteran Daniel Gimeno-Traver. Aljaz Bedene, who has switched from Slovenia to Great Britain, lost in Casablanca (not pictured) The 21-year-old rising Czech star put paid to Bedene's good start to life under the official British banner, after the London-based 25-year-old changed nationality last month. Vesely saw off Mikhail Youzhny on Thursday despite all his luggage being lost in transit from Rome and borrowing kit from doubles partner Frantisek Cermak. That victory ended a seven-match losing streak, and he continued his resurgence to sweep past Bedene without issue. Bedene's conqueror Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic will play Gimeno-Traver in the semi-finals. Vesely's next opponent Gimeno-Traver dropped just six points on his first serve in a 6-4 6-3 victory over Lamine Ouahab. Second seed Martin Klizan saw off Nicolas Almagro 6-4 7-6 (6/3), meanwhile, denying his Spanish opponent a 250th career win on clay.

"Rangers have been fined £5,500 by the Scottish Football Association after admitting the previous board breached 'dual ownership' rules by allowing Newcastle chief Mike Ashley into Ibrox. The Sports Direct tycoon owns 9.82 per cent of the Glasgow giants but is prohibited from going over 10 per cent by an agreement struck with Hampden chiefs designed to limit his power at Ibrox. But that did not stop Ashley exerting influence. Two of his closest associates - Derek Llambias and Barry Leach - sat as directors until King forced them out at last month's general meeting. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley bought a 9.8 per cent stake in Rangers and loaned the club £5million. Ashley gave the club's old board a £5million loan in January which remains outstanding. That agreement gives the 50-year-old a floating charge on the club as well as security on a number of assets, including Murray Park and the club's registered trademarks. Representatives of the new board arrived at Hampden at 2pm on Thursday to appear before the SFA's Judicial Panel. Ashley's close associate Derek Llambias sat as director as Ashley exerted his influence. During a three-hour meeting they admitted the club had breached Disciplinary Rule 1, which requires member clubs to 'behave towards the Scottish FA and other members with the utmost good faith' - and were fined £5,000. A second fine of £500 was also imposed after Rangers admitted a breach of Disciplinary Rule 19 - which relates to dual ownership. Ashley - the world's 306th richest man, worth an estimated £3.3billion - was fined £7,500 for breaching Disciplinary Rule 19 last month.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Rangers have been fined £5,500 by the Scottish Football Association after admitting the previous board breached 'dual ownership' rules by allowing Newcastle chief Mike Ashley into Ibrox.

"Maverick Tottenham forward Emmanuel Adebayor has insisted that he is happy to stay and fight for his place at White Hart Lane and rejected reports linking him with a move away. Taking to Twitter on Tuesday night, the 31-year-old Togo international expressed his gratitude at being able to play in the Premier League and labeled the division 'the best in the world.' Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer.

Adebayor gives an underwhelming performance against League One side Sheffield United in the League Cup. The striker's significantly more modest form since then, however, coupled with the meteoric rise of homegrown star Harry Kane, have left Adebayor little more than a bit-part in the Spurs machine. This season, he has made just 16 appearances in all competitions, scoring only twice and has been criticised for several underwhelming performances, in particular his showing against League One's Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Yet, the former Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City hitman remains adamant that he will see out the remainder of his contract in north London. Adebayor's last Premier League goal for Spurs came during a 1-2 defeat by Newcastle back in October last year. Adebayor has made just 10 appearances in all competitions this season and scored only twice.

Pavel Yaremenko was at the shopping centre and said the problems started when the boys began to 'fool around' at the top of the building. The 29-year-old said: 'I don't think they really intended to jump, but their friends were encouraging them so they decided to do it. 'Once they started picking up speed they must have regretted it but it was too late to stop then. A teenager is in intensive care and another has a broken coccyx after they drunkenly slid down a glass shopping centre roof and crashed onto stone steps in Kiev, Ukraine. Jacob Polyakov (orange top) and Jamal Maslow (blue top), both 17, quickly gathered speed and hit the stone steps below the edge of the roof with some speed. Witnesses rushed over to the teenagers, both 17, after the accident and found Mr Maslow in huge amounts of pain. Mr Polyakov was unconscious. 'They really hit the ground fast.' The video was captured by one of the boy's friends. Both Mr Maslow and Mr Polyakov were taken to hospital.' Provide only the summary as the response.",4896603c677d4d0e94b12d8486c2174e
"Juventus moved ever closer to clinching a fourth straight Serie A title by beating nearest challengers Lazio 2-0 in Turin. First-half goals from Carlos Tevez - his 26th of the season in all competitions - and centre-back Leonardo Bonucci pushed Juve 15 points clear of second place with only seven games remaining. Lazio did mount a late rally at the Juventus Stadium but the dismissal of midfielder Danilo Cataldi for a heavy tackle on Tevez ended their challenge. Carlos Tevez opened the scoring for Juventus after 17 minutes as they beat Lazio on Saturday. Tevez jumps for joy after firing Juventus ahead with his 26th goal of the season. The result brought Lazio's run of six consecutive victories to an end and the Biancocelesti could be dragged back into third place should their city rivals Roma beat Atalanta in the capital on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, ambitious Sampdoria were held to an unlikely goalless draw by Cesena but used the point to take a share of fourth place. The Genoa club dominated their relegation-threatened opponents from start to finish but found goalkeeper Federico Agliardi an immovable object when their radar was not malfunctioning. Samp are now level on Napoli with 50 points while 18th-placed Cesena are six points shy of Atalanta and safety with seven games still to play.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Juventus moved ever closer to clinching a fourth straight Serie A title by beating nearest challengers Lazio 2-0 in Turin.

"Carlo Ancelotti has revealed Karim Benzema will miss Real Madrid's La Liga game at home to Malaga on Saturday after the Frenchman limped out of training with a knee problem. Benzema, who picked up the injury in Tuesday's 0-0 Champions League quarter-final first leg draw at Atletico Madrid, should be fit for the return game at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. 'Benzema is not available (for Saturday) but we will have him back for the next game,' added the Italian. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out of his side's La Liga match against Malaga. Benzema rolls around on the floor during Real Madrid's quarter-final clash against rivals Atletico. Losing their first-choice striker, even if just for one match, is a blow to the European champions at a crucial stage of the season. Benzema has scored 15 goals during the La Liga campaign and six in the Champions League this term.

Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure remains a top target for Serie A giants Inter Milan. Toure, pictured with Vincent Kompany, will be offered a new deal by Manchester City in the summer. Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is keen on bringing Toure to the San Siro. The Italian believes Toure has the capacity to dominate games in Serie A well into his mid-30s, like Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has. The midfielder's representatives are fully aware of Inter's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer. City want to keep Toure, who currently earns £220,000-per-week, and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season, which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over. But Inter will test City's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England. The 31-year-old scored a consolation goal in Manchester City's surprise 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace. Toure walks off the Selhurst Park pitch following his side's Premier League defeat at Selhurst Park.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Inter Milan are prepared to offer Yaya Toure a five-year contract to lure him away from Manchester City this summer.

"Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels is leaving his options open amid speculation he may leave the club in the summer as he admits he is contemplating leaving the club. The German centre-back gave an interview in Kicker magazine last week in which he demanded a stronger Dortmund team for next season, otherwise he may consider his own future. The Westphalians seem certain to miss out on a place in the Champions League next season while they may not even qualify for the Europa League, and Hummels has admitted again he may not be sticking with the club for much longer. Mats Hummels has admitted he is considering his future at Borussia Dortmund. The Germany defender has consistently been linked with a big-money move to Manchester United. 'That doesn't mean that I am leaving, it just means I'm reflecting,' he told Sky television following a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich at the weekend. 'There's no particular tendency one way or the other. It's just thoughts going through my mind. It will all become clearer in the coming weeks.' In 2007, when he moved to Dortmund from Bayern, he turned down an approach from Hoffenheim and said that was a 'gut feeling'. Hummels closes down Mario Gotze during Dortmund's 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich on Saturday. 'It's going to be the same again this time,' added the 26-year-old, who still has two years left to run on his contract with Dortmund, but has already attracted attention from several other clubs around Europe. Manchester United were reportedly willing to offer up to £30million for his services - an amount Dortmund may struggle to reject if they cannot count on earning that sort of money from the Champions League next season.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels is leaving his options open amid speculation he may leave the club in the summer as he admits he is contemplating leaving the club.

However the tournament, held at Roland Garros and beginning on May 24, remains the Grand Slam with the lowest prize for the singles champion, lagging behind the Australian Open (£1.56m), Wimbledon (£1.7m) and the US Open (£2.03m).

"Reading manager Steve Clarke and his players will rally round goalkeeper Adam Federici to help him get over his Wembley gaffe. The Australian blew his side’s chances of beating Arsenal in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final by spilling Alexis Sanchez’s shot into his own net in extra-time. Federici was inconsolable after the match and Clarke revealed: ‘I tried to hug him but he was very, very disappointed. He just wanted to get inside and have his sad moment by himself. You have to respect that. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Adam Federici in extra time. It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp. The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. ‘When he comes into training we’ll have a little chat but he’ll be fine. He’s a professional.’ The incident was reminiscent of Robert Green’s error in England’s 2010 World Cup opener against the USA, when Clint Dempsey’s strike got through him. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan added of Federici: ‘He’s one of the best goalkeepers around and they all make mistakes. ‘The saves he made earlier were top-class and he was probably man of the match up to that point. Nobody will blame him.’ Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. The Reading goalkeeper left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him.

The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game. Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp. ‘When he comes into training we’ll have a little chat but he’ll be fine. He’s a professional.’ The incident was reminiscent of Robert Green’s error in England’s 2010 World Cup opener against the USA, when Clint Dempsey’s strike got through him. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan added of Federici: ‘He’s one of the best goalkeepers around and they all make mistakes. ‘The saves he made earlier were top-class and he was probably man of the match up to that point. Nobody will blame him.’ Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. The Reading goalkeeper left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him. Federici's opposite number, Wojciech Szczesny (left) of Arsenal comforts his fellow goalkeeper.'

"Belgian teenager Obbi Oulare scored as Club Brugge came from behind to beat Anderlecht in front of scouts from a number of Europe’s top clubs. Scouts from Manchester United, Everton, Sunderland, Burnley, Dortmund and Leverkusen were in Belgium to watch the top of the table clash. And Sportsmail understands 19-year-old Oulare was the reason the scouts from England and Germany were in attendance. Club Brugge forward Obbi Oulare holds off a defender during his side's Europa League game last week. Oulare started against Dinpro in midweek and scored against Anderlecht for the Brugge on Sunday. And he did not disappoint as he scored in the 74th minute after a Timmy Simons own goal to put Anderlecht ahead. Ruud Vormer then scored with four minutes remaining to take all three points and extend Club Brugge’s lead at the top of the league to four points. Oulare is the son of former Guinea international Souleymane Oulare and has represented Belgium at Under 18 and 19 level before making his U21 debut against Moldova in March. The young striker came through the youth ranks at Lille, the same academy that has produced the likes of Liverpool loanee Divock Origi and Chelsea star Eden Hazard, also both Belgian. The young striker is being watched by some of Europe's top clubs, including Manchester United. Despite being just 19 years of age, Oulare is a strong forward, and has scored four times this season.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Belgian teenager Obbi Oulare scored as Club Brugge came from behind to beat Anderlecht in front of scouts from a number of Europe’s top clubs.

"A mother is demanding $300,000 from a school claiming her son would rather commit suicide than face his bullies. Ashley Shupe claims Kaiden, eight, has tried to choke himself, throw himself from a height, and stop eating. It was a reaction, she claims to repeated 'taunting, bullying and physical assault' inflicted by one student in his class at Oakmont Elementary School in Dickson County, Tennessee, for more than a year since Spetember 2013. Distraught: Ashley Shupe says her eight-year-old son Kaiden (pictured together) is suicidal after being bullied. Police: After the latest alleged attack, Shupe took these pictures of Kaiden's injuries and filed a police report. Eventually, in March this year, Shupe filed a police report against the child when Kaiden allegedly came home with a swollen and bruised head, bruises on his knees, and scratches. According to the lawsuit, filed last month, Kaiden was diagnosed with clinical depression in October 2013, a month into the alleged attacks. Despite notifying the school, Shupe says they continued to let the children interact. By April 2014, she claims, Kaiden began to display 'odd behaviour'. Anger: Shupe is demanding $300,000 for the school district's negligence in protecting her son. He tried 'to choke himself' and warned 'he may harm himself', the suit, read by The Tennessean, states. In a lawsuit, Ms Shupe accuses the school of failing to adequately protect her child despite witnessing the attacks and being notified that Kaiden had been diagnosed with depression. The school, she says, agreed to formally separate the children in April 2014, but that was not adhered to.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A mother is demanding $300,000 from a school claiming her son would rather commit suicide than face his bullies.

"There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers. An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One. Saturday's visit of Fleetwood Town, who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated, hardly promised to be a thriller. Doncaster's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan. Doncaster's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw. And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium. It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club's YouTube channel. So they made it short and sweet, just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action.  Just enough time for the kick off, a goal kick and the final whistle. A must-see video for all football fans. The managers on the touchline during Saturday's goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'There's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers.

"This stunning series of photographs offer a bird's eye view of the moment a great grey owl swooped on a tiny field mouse. The bird, which has a five-foot wingspan, stalked the rodent from snowy treetops in Ontario, Canada, before launching its attack. Its eyes never straying from its prey, it made a somewhat inelegant landing in the snow before scooping up the mouse with its claws. The great grey owl is a deadly predator, its hunting skills aided by its superior sense of hearing. Its soft feathers allow the bird to glide unheard, taking its prey by surprise. Photographer Marc Latremouille captured this particular encounter during one of his photography workshops. Scroll down for video. This is the moment a great grey owl swooped on a tiny rodent snowy fields in Ontario, Canada, after stalking it from high above. The predatory bird has an impressive wingspan of around five feet. It is is clothed in soft feathers making its attacks almost silent. Making a somewhat inelegant landing in the snow, the bird clutches onto the mouse with its claws, all the while being captured on film. Great grey owls are solitary hunters with often the only sign of their presence in the wild being imprints left in the snow from when they strike. The huge bird lunges towards the bird after abandoning its perch on a bare tree in the snowy wild. Its light feathers allow for a quiet arrival. With its eyes never straying from its prey, the bird hovers above ground with its long wings stretched out before launching its attack. The grey owl stalks its prey from a perch in the field before choosing its moment to strike, its sharp claws ready to strike upon landing.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'This stunning series of photographs offer a bird's eye view of the moment a great grey owl swooped on a tiny field mouse.

"Saracens are sweating over the availability of Billy Vunipola for Saturday’s Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont after the No 8 was cited on Monday night for an alleged butt. The 22-year-old faces an RFU disciplinary panel on Tuesday afternoon and could face an immediate suspension following an accusation that he struck Leicester’s Mathew Tait. The full-back required attention after the 29th-minute collision at Allianz Park, where Vunipola was penalised for coming in at the side of a ruck but not for making contact with his head. Billy Vunipola (left) takes on Niall Morris during Saracens' Aviva Premiership win over Leicester. Former England full back Mathew Tait was caught by Vunipola during the match at Allianz Park. With Saracens travelling to France as underdogs this weekend, director of rugby Mark McCall will be desperate for his in-form back-row to be cleared. Meanwhile, Toulon are plotting a move for Australia fly-half Quade Cooper after missing out on Sale’s Danny Cipriani, who signed a new deal in February. According to reports in France, the Cote d’Azur club have tabled an offer for the Wallaby No 10 who is expected to travel to France this week to discuss terms with owner Mourad Boudjellal, who made his fortune in the comic book industry. Boudjellal has already failed to land All Black fly-halves Dan Carter and Colin Slade and is still searching for a long-term successor to Jonny Wilkinson.

"Australia captain Michael Clarke believes Kevin Pietersen could play in this summer's Ashes Test series. The 34-year-old has not played for his country since the fifth Test in Sydney, a match England lost to complete a 5-0 series defeat Down Under.

Downton has since left his role and Pietersen has signed for Surrey with the intent of scoring the runs which would earn him a recall. He scored 170 against Oxford MCCU recently and Clarke feels Pietersen could represent his country again. 'I do think he could be at the Ashes,' said Clarke. 'He has certainly scored enough runs. 'He has made it very clear he wants to play and now it will come down to the England selectors and England board making a decision. Pietersen has not featured for England since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago. The former England star is hoping to win back his Test place with a return to red ball cricket. 'But at the moment from the Australians' perspective, I'm happy if he is not playing because he is a wonderful player.'

"The MCC has announced the latest phase of its 'Masterplan' redevelopment of Lord's which includes the replacement of the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands. The intention is to build a single new structure in their place, with more than 5,500 seats, in the south-western corner of the home of cricket - to raise the ground's overall capacity to almost 30,000. MCC is operating to a projected budget of £80million, and hopes work can begin in autumn 2017 - subject to planning permission, consultation with nearby residents and the approval of club members. MCC reveals plans to replace the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands at Lord's, with completion scheduled for 2019. The redevelopment will increase the overall capacity of Lord's, the home of English cricket, to almost 30,000. If the project goes ahead, a new Thomas Lord Building and new Tavern pub will also be included - as well as enlarged dressing rooms in the pavilion and a 'more pedestrian-friendly entrance to the ground', via the Grace Gates. MCC chief executive Derek Brewer said: 'The south-western project will ensure facilities for players, match officials, supporters and MCC members are of the highest possible standard by modernising areas of the ground that have become tired. 'MCC is committed to maintaining Lord's as the finest cricket ground in the world, and this project also provides a wonderful new front door to the home of cricket.' MCC aims to submit a planning application to Westminster City Council this summer. A completion schedule for the new stand is spring 2019, in time for that summer's World Cup and Ashes. It is anticipated the remaining elements of the 'Masterplan' may take a further three years. The 'Masterplan', which has a projected budget of £80million, should be ready for the World Cup and Ashes.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'The MCC has announced the latest phase of its 'Masterplan' redevelopment of Lord's which includes the replacement of the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands.

"Sampdoria have revived their interest in Mario Balotelli should he choose to take a pay cut. Eccentric club president Massimo Ferrero says the talented but frustrating 24-year-old has lost his desire for football and needs to go to Stadio Luigi Ferraris to re-discover himself. Liverpool have been willing to sell Balotelli since January but could find no takers after signing him for £16m. Mario Balotelli has only scored once in the Premier League since his switch to Liverpool last summer. The Italian striker is set to leave the club at the end of the season and Sampdoria want to sign him. The Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero says that Balotelli has lost his hunger. Ferrero said Balotelli should be put on a diet of bread and water and given a Bianchina (a small car from the 1960s) instead of a Ferrari. His agent Mino Raiola has also hinted Liverpool would have to pay him off first after saying he wanted to finish his contract and prove to the Anfield crowd he was good enough. Tentative loan offers have been proposed and Sampdoria would likely offer a cut price permanent move. Ferrero said: 'I’d sign him. If he came to Sampdoria, he would come back to his usual standards. Here nobody would bother him if he missed a goal, he would be quiet and happy.' Talking to Gazzetta TV, Ferrero added: 'In my opinion he’s not hungry anymore, he earns 4 million euros (£2.9m) a year. We should put him on bread and water, give him a Bianchina [a small car from the 1960s] rather than a Ferrari… then I’m sure he would score again.'","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Sampdoria have revived their interest in Mario Balotelli should he choose to take a pay cut.

In an adorable video posted to YouTube by user Jeannine S. with nearly one million views, puppy Bonnie can be seen lifting her dish to bring it over to her canine friend Clyde who is also scarfing down a meal. Bonnie lifts the dish into her mouth and scuttles her paws backwards to dine along with Clyde. Given a dish: Bonnie's new owner feeds her a dish of food away from his other dog Clyde. Clyde continues to focus on his plate and isn't bothered by his new company and from the sound of their names, it sounds like they might become partners in crime-or 'pawtners' in dog speak.

"Wildlife officials in Alaska are going to kill a mother bear and her four cubs after the family started eating out from trash cans in a busy neighborhood. The black bears were spotted in the Government Hill area of Anchorage several days in a row, nosing through overturned receptacles and putting the neighborhood on alert. Residents were warned to keep their distance and make sure pets stayed on a leash in light of the hungry predators. Scroll down for video. Execution planned: Wildlife authorities in Anchorage, Alaska, said they will kill this family of a mother bear and her four children after they starting eating from trash cans in the area. Officials with Alaska's Department of Fish and Game ruled Thursday that killing the family was the only option as once they develop a taste for trash they are likely to return even if moved. According to the Alaska Dispatch News, the mother bear was seen huffing and looking 'defensive' on Thursday after residents started taking cell phone pictures of the animals. They eventually climbed a tree to flee, but are still likely to cause trouble in the area. The local council has suggested buying in bear-proof garbage cans in a bid to stop more bears moving in on the area. Officials did not give an exact time when they would move in and kill the bears, but a Twitter account for Government Hill's council said the deed would be done 'in the next few days'. Watch out: The bears have been spotted several times around the Government Hill neighborhood of the city. One is shown above outside a property.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Wildlife officials in Alaska are going to kill a mother bear and her four cubs after the family started eating out from trash cans in a busy neighborhood.

"Fernando Torres has played with some great players over the years but the on-loan Atletico Madrid striker regards Steven Gerrard as the best. Torres spent three-and-half-seasons at the English club and struck up a close friendship with the former England captain, even returning to Anfield to play in his charity match against Jamie Carragher's side. Since leaving the club in 2011, Torres has never quite found his best form - suffering a miserable time with Chelsea before signing for AC Milan and returning to Atletico on loan. He has scored four times since heading back to Spain in January. Fernando Torres (left) and Steven Gerrard became good friends during his successful career at Liverpool. He told Marca Plus Magazine: 'Out of all the great players I have played with, Gerrard, for me, is the best. 'But he is more than that - he is a good friend who, as a captain, is always there for his players. 'I know what Liverpool means to him, so yes I would have loved to see my friend finish his final season with a trophy, but it was not to be. 'He has had so much success for Liverpool that I am sure the final game is going to be very emotional for him and the fans.'

"Dick Advocaat has serious concerns over the strength of Sunderland’s players ahead of their relegation run-in. The Black Cats are two places and three points above the drop zone but have won just one in nine and end their season with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. It has left them as odds-on with some bookmakers to finish inside the bottom three come May 24. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat has concerns about the physical strength of his players. Advocaat has never been relegated during 28 years as a manager but admits he is worried about that record having watched Sunderland slump to a 4-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday. Next up is a trip to Stoke City and the Dutch boss fears his team lacks the muscle for such a test. ‘We are not a real physical team,’ said the 67-year-old. ‘If you compare us with the other teams, that’s a big difference. ‘In the Premier League, you need physical players as well. We have to think about that for the game with Stoke City. Sunderland were beaten 4-1 by Crystal Palace on Saturday and are three points above the relegation zone. ‘We have different type of players, who are more combination players, than with more pace. ‘We have to find a combination to create chances and win games.

"Manny Pacquiao literally got two words in before a conference call about his fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr was abruptly cancelled on Monday.

Manny Pacquiao's conference call about his fight against Floyd Mayweather was cancelled during media event. The Filipino, pictured during last week's media day, could only answer one question due to technical issues. Pacquiao was on the call from Los Angeles for what was supposed to be his last question and answer session before he arrives in Las Vegas next week for the May 2 fight. But the only question he answered was from a Top Rank PR person about how his training camp was going, to which Pacquiao responded 'very good.' Promoter Bob Arum, who was also on the call, then got frustrated when the first caller in the queue wasn't someone who was supposed to be in line to ask a question. 'Let's reorganise and do this call some other time, please,' Arum said. Samuels said there were so many people calling in that some were unable to get on the call. He apologised and said it would be rescheduled. Mayweather is supposed to have his own conference call on Wednesday.

His form this season has been excellent and he has contributed 13 assists as well as seven goals from midfield; he will be considered for the role of club captain when Steven Gerrard moves to LA Galaxy. Talks with Raheem Sterling are not expected to resume until the end of the season but Ian Ayre, Liverpool's Chief Executive, last week said he expected the England forward to be at Anfield for 'a long time'.

"Forget a feather down pillow - this boy would rather use his cat's belly as a place to rest his head. California-based YouTube user Lionel Hutz filmed his young son chasing the family feline around the garden in a bid to get some rest. Footage shows the cat  licking his fur before his human friend comes along and plonks himself on top. After a brief moment of stillness, the cat immediately gets up and scurries over to another spot. The boy then proceeds to follow the pet to his new location. Eager to get some rest, the infant repeats the same move and rolls to the ground. The sequence happens one more time before the cat decides he's had enough of being used as a pillow and wanders off indoors.

"Whoever snatched a seal or sea lion pup from a Los Angeles beach early Sunday should not confuse the animal's cuteness with its potentially vicious bite, according to an animal rescue expert. Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup in a blanket and left in a car around 3:20 a.m. from Dockweiler State Beach, just west of the city's international airport, said Los Angeles Police Officer Rosario Herrera. The initial police report said the animal was a small seal. Marine Animal Rescue managed to save another young sea lion shortly after the animal escaped several people said to be harassing it. Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup (not pictured) in a blanket and left in a car around  from Dockweiler State Beach. But a companion pup that escaped and was later found on the beach is a sea lion, according to Peter Wallerstein, the president of the group Marine Animal Rescue. The rescued pup weighs about 25 pounds and is probably 10 months old, said Wallerstein, who stays in a trailer at the beach and was woken by security guards seeking his help. Sea lions of this size are 'really small, really look cute, but they're dangerous,' he said. 'These are wild animals.' They're also not fit to be kept as pets. Though small pups are cute they can be very dangerous, officials warned. 'The animal needs fluids, needs special treatments,' he said. 'You can't just feed it dog food. It's not going to work.' Los Angeles police said an investigation was being conducted by the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A spokesman for the agency did not return phone messages or an email Sunday.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Whoever snatched a seal or sea lion pup from a Los Angeles beach early Sunday should not confuse the animal's cuteness with its potentially vicious bite, according to an animal rescue expert.

"Israel is developing a system to accurately detect tunnelling activity, it has been revealed. The 'first of its kind' equipment, developed by Elbit Systems working with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, will be able to detect activity at a distance using a series of sensors. These sensors were so precise there would be 'no false alarms'. The decision comes after the Israeli army considered more than 700 proposals aimed at combating a tunnel threat. Israel is developing a system to accurately detect tunnelling activity, it has been revealed. Above, an Israeli soldier inspects a tunnel in August 2014. It is thought the system will cost around £2.3million ($3.5m) per mile to install. A proposed area to introduce it is along the land border between Gaza and Israel, officials said. Alon Shuster, head of Sha’ar Hanegev regional council, told The Times of Israel the move would be welcomed by residents. He said: 'This advancement provides an additional layer of security.' The exact time-frame of the project has not been made clear, although it has been reported it will take around a year to install. It comes after years of fighting between Israel and Gaza. It is thought the system will cost around £2.3million ($3.5m) per mile to install. Above, Palestinian men look at what used to be a tunnel. Israeli military spokesmen have previously said the aim of some of their attacks was to destroy cross-border tunnels, which are usually around one metre wide and 2.5 metres tall. Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated the concern about tunnels in August 2014 and said soldiers were completing 'neutralisation' of the underground network.

"When pretty much any vehicle is rear ended by a tank...there is only going to be one outcome - and a very costly insurance bill. And that's exactly what happened when this poor truck driver had a nasty prang with the huge armoured vehicle during rush hour in Changchun city, China, on Thursday April 16. The dramatic collision is being dubbed the 'craziest rear-end collision in the country', reports the People's Daily Online. Pictures and videos of the scene were posted to Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, and quickly went viral. According to eyewitnesses, the accident happened on the Rainbow Plaza roundabout. It's unclear whether or not this is a military tank serving the state army, but footage shows people inside the vehicle were wearing camouflage uniforms. No comments have been given by the authorities regarding the cause of the incident. Chinese internet users however take great interests in the unusual collision. In addition to calling it 'craziest', many are concerned over the insurance compensation. 'How does compensation work? Is the police going to pay that? How about the government?' Asked one user named 'The Sun is shining on America'.

"Andrea Dossena, the defender Liverpool once paid £7million for, will face no further action after he was accused of shoplifting in Harrods. The 33-year-old, now with League One strugglers Leyton Orient, hit headlines around the world when he was arrested at the Knightsbridge store on April 7. However, Metropolitan Police have confirmed that the Italian and a 31-year-old woman also held at the scene, were released after being interviewed. Andrea Dossena (scoring against Real Madrid) will face no further action after being accused of shoplifting. Dossena, whose crowning moment for Liverpool came when he scored the winner against Real Madrid in the Champions League, last turned out for the relegation-fighting Os on April 14 in a 1-0 home loss to Doncaster Rovers. He also netted four days after that strike against Real back in March 2009, lobbing Edwin van der Sar away at Manchester United in a 4-1 win. Dossena, whose signing was seen as something of a coup for Orient, earned around £40,000-a-week at Anfield. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'A 33-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman who were arrested on suspicion of shoplifting were advised on April 10 that they would face no further action.' Dossena signed a short-term contract with League One strugglers Leyton Orient back in November. Sportsmail understands officers accepted Dossena's claims that he had simply forgotten to pay for a couple of items. Dossena has been capped by Italy on 10 occasions and joined the Os from Sunderland for whom he played under Paolo Di Canio and Gus Poyet. He was heralded by Rafa Benitez on arriving on Merseyside from Udinese back in 2008, but made only 13 Premier League starts for the club.

Edinson Cavani celebrates with the French League Cup trophy after scoring twice in the final against Bastia. The Uruguayan forward is a target for Manchester United but looks set to stay in Paris.

"Experienced Juventus defender and 76-cap Italy international Giorgio Chiellini has made his case for football's most obvious foul. Inside the first minute of Juve's Champions League quarter-final second-leg against Monaco on Wednesday night, the 30-year-old centre-half committed a deliberate handball after slipping onto the turf. With Monaco danger man Joao Moutinho ready to pounce on the Italian's mistake, Chiellini resorted to desperation tactics, comically clawing the ball out of the way and earning himself a yellow card. Giorgio Chiellini scrambles to recover the loose ball after slipping on the turf against Monaco on Wednesday. The Italy international is shown a deserved yellow card after his bizarre handball at the Stade Louis II.

"Saudi Arabian footballer Emad Sahabi suffered a gruesome broken ankle while playing for his club Al Orubah against Al Shoalah. The match came to halt on 19 minutes when the midfielder's ankle appeared to have twisted 180 degrees after chasing down the ball - much to the horror of his team-mates. It seemed innocuous, as he tumbled over under pressure before his joint snapped and appeared to dislocate, leaving it hanging off the end of his leg. Emad Sahabi writhes in pain after suffering an horrific ankle break while playing for Al Orubah. Al Orubah went on to win the game 2-0 but the result was overshadowed by Sahabi's horror injury. The break brings back the nightmare injuries suffered by Arsenal duo Eduardo and Aaron Ramsey a few years ago. Both men were out for over a year and it would appear Sahabi has a long road to recovery ahead of him.

The photo has been organised by the Chelsea Supporters Trust and Playfair Qatar, an organisation raining awareness about the conditions many migrant workers face in the Arab state. Photo protest will take place outside Stamford Bridge at 3pm on Saturday ahead of Manchester United game. There have been more than 1,400 confirmed deaths of construction workers in Qatar as the country put the infrastructure in place to host the World Cup.

"A piano teacher awaiting a jury's verdict on charges claiming he sexually assaulted an underage student has shot himself outside a New Hampshire courthouse, court officials say. Authorities say 75-year-old John Goodwin, of Atkinson, went on trial this week on six counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. Prosecutors said that Atkinson, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted a student, who is now 24 years old, according to SeaCoastOnline. John Goodwin, 75, shot himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student. The former student testified he didn't come forward until 2013 because he was embarrassed, according to WMUR. The station reports Goodwin's lawyer acknowledged his client was 'touchy-feely,' but he didn't commit a crime. Court officials say the jury was deliberating when Goodwin shot himself late Friday morning near his car in a parking lot outside Rockingham County Superior Courthouse. He wasn't in custody. Court officials say Goodwin was airlifted to a hospital with life-threatening injuries from the self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to WPTZ. His health status has not been immediately disclosed. As of Friday afternoon, jurors were still deliberating, but court officials would not say if the jurors knew about the shooting. The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office is expected to release more information about the incident Friday evening.

He took the footage with his friend Ricky Bailey while the two were out in a tractor on Wednesday evening. Scroll down for video. Vortex: Stan Cole, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, filmed this landspout from just 100 yards away in Loraine, Texas. Cole told local news station KTXS that he felt chunks of mud start hitting the vehicle, at which point the two hopped out and started filming. He said: 'Perhaps 10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, my danger meter needs to be recalibrated'. Landspouts - the scientific term for tornadoes which are not part of a thunderstorm - can be difficult to capture on film. The wind formations tend not to last much longer than 15 minutes, and are too small-scale to appear on weather radars. Other landspout photographs emerged Wednesday night from the area around Loraine. Various social media users posted images of a clearly-defined spout working its way through fields - though it is not clear whether that was the same spout captured in Cole's video. Spotted: Other photographs from Loraine showed landspouts - a term for any tornado not attachde to a thunderstorm - on Wednesday evening. Unexpected: Landspouts are not easy to predict because the wind formations that form them are too small to be picked up on radar.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'This too-close-for-comfort video shows a swirling 'landspout' tornado tearing up the Texas countryside from just 100 yards away.

Cole told local news station KTXS that he felt chunks of mud start hitting the vehicle, at which point the two hopped out and started filming. He said: 'Perhaps 10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, my danger meter needs to be recalibrated'. Landspouts - the scientific term for tornadoes which are not part of a thunderstorm - can be difficult to capture on film. The wind formations tend not to last much longer than 15 minutes, and are too small-scale to appear on weather radars. Other landspout photographs emerged Wednesday night from the area around Loraine. Various social media users posted images of a clearly-defined spout working its way through fields - though it is not clear whether that was the same spout captured in Cole's video. Spotted: Other photographs from Loraine showed landspouts - a term for any tornado not attachde to a thunderstorm - on Wednesday evening. Unexpected: Landspouts are not easy to predict because the wind formations that form them are too small to be picked up on radar.'

"Manchester United have identified Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan as the leading contender to fill Michael Carrick's midfield role. United are eyeing a £20.5million deal for the central midfielder, and reports emanating from Germany on Friday indicated a deal is now close - though those claims were later denied. United will seek to sign Carrick's successor this summer as part of another huge spending frenzy. Manchester United are closing in on a deal to sign Borussia Dortmund ace Ilkay Gundogan. Gundogan vies for the ball with Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal in the Champions League. Dortmund's ball-playing midfielder Gundogan has been watched extensively by United and has emerged as their primary target. Van Gaal has an intrinsic knowledge of the Bundesliga and believes the 24-year-old has the ability to take over from Carrick on a long-term basis. Carrick, who recently signed a new 12 month extension, will continue to be part of Van Gaal's plans next season - but the club are planning for life without him. Louis van Gaal believes the midfielder is the perfect replacement for current midfielder Michael Carrick. Van Gaal has been hugely impressed with Carrick's contribution at Old Trafford this season. The England international's passing range and ability to dictate the pace of a match has been a key feature for United this season. But at the age of 33, the Dutchman knows the midfielder is in the twilight of his career, while the amount of time Carrick has spent injured this season is also a worry.

"Men do almost twice the amount of housework after they retire - but they are still doing far less than their wives, according to new research. The study of 1,302 German couples found working men did just two hours of house work each day, which almost doubled to 3.9 hours when they retired. But they are still lagging behind their stay-at-home female partners when it comes to sharing the burden. Division of labour: Men do just two hours of housework a day while working, which increases to 3.9 after they retire - but it is still far less than the amount carried out by their stay-at-home wives. The study, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, found women who did not work did an average of 6.8 hours before their husband's retired. Chores included doing the laundry and the washing up, as well as running errands, according to New York Magazine. However, the number of hours they did each day only dropped to 6.1 after their husbands retired. What's more, it seems the men were still avoiding the washing up, even post-retirement. The research noted the increase in the men's hours was mainly taken up by more 'manly' chores - like repairs and gardening. However, the study - conducted by Thomas Leopold at the University of Amsterdam and Jan Skopek at the European University Institute - does not reveal how the burden was shared when both the husband and wife were working. Manly: The men were also less likely to do the 'female' chores, sticking to gardening and repairs.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Men do almost twice the amount of housework after they retire - but they are still doing far less than their wives, according to new research.

"Dietmar Hamann believes Bastian Schweinsteiger should leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season after losing his place to Xabi Alonso in Pep Guardiola's side. The World Cup winner was an unused substitute in Bayern's 6-1 Champions League win over Porto on Tuesday. And former Germany international Hamann thinks Schweinsteiger faces an uncertain future at the Allianz Arena, with Alonso viewed as Guardiola's preferred midfield choice. Bastian Schweinsteiger speaks with Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola during training this week. Dietmar Hamann (above) thinks World Cup winner Schweinsteiger may be heading for the Bayern exit. 'The game against Porto was quite meaningful for two players in particular,' Hamann told Kicker. 'Schweinsteiger has apparently lost the battle for a place in midfield to Xabi Alonso. I do not think Schweinsteiger will still be playing for Bayern next year.' Meanwhile, Hamann also expressed his doubts over whether injured winger Franck Ribery would fit seamlessly back into the side when fit, given the form of Thomas Muller in his absence. 'It will also be quite tricky for Ribery,' he added. 'If you have to make a choice between Ribery and Muller once Robben returns, I would always pick Muller.' Ribery last played for Bayern on March 11 during the 7-0 Champions League win over Shakhtar Donetsk.

"Toulon have announced the signing of Australia star Quade Cooper. In a statement on the official club website, Toulon said that 27-year-old Cooper had agreed a two-year deal and will move to France this summer. The Queensland Reds fly-half, who has won 53 caps, becomes the latest Australia international to move abroad, following players like Will Genia, James Horwill and Adam Ashley-Cooper. Quade Cooper played against England in the Autumn Internationals and will join Toulon this summer. Former Wallabies playmaker Matt Giteau has guided the Top 14 side to the European Champions Cup final. He is currently injured, though, and continuing his recovery from a broken shoulder-blade that he suffered playing for the Reds earlier this month. Bernard Foley is favourite to wear the Wallabies number 10 shirt for their World Cup campaign, which starts against Fiji in Cardiff on September 23. Cooper, meanwhile, will link up with former Wallabies playmaker Matt Giteau, who has been instrumental in guiding the French club to this season's European Champions Cup final. Toulon are chasing an unprecedented hat-trick of European titles, and they will play Clermont Auvergne in the final at Twickenham in eight days' time.

"Luis Suarez's wife Sofia has revealed that the Barcelona star told her he didn't bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup in Brazil - before admitting the truth 10 days later. The Uruguayan received a four-month ban for the incident and was condemned by world football but still completed a £75million move from Liverpool to the La Liga side. His wife admits that Suarez didn't believe that he had done anything but the television replays suggested otherwise and he then owned up. Luis Suarez (right) was handed a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup match. The Uruguay striker bites down on the Italian's shoulder in front of the watching television cameras. Sofia told Canal 10: 'He told me he hadn’t done it. That is what he had in his head and even I began to believe it. But the television and radio spoke only about the bite and after 10 days of us being alone he told me the truth. 'On the day of the game I phoned him and asked what he had done. He responded with ‘what?’ The same had happened in England and I insisted: ‘Again?’ He replied: ‘I haven’t done anything. Are you not happy because Uruguay qualified?' Ever since his ban was uplifted, Suarez has shone for his new side alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, with the La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey treble still very much a possibility. Sofia, seen her with her husband at Anfield, says that he told her that he didn't bite the defender. The Uruguayan has been in superb form for Barcelona since joining the club from Liverpool in the summer.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Luis Suarez's wife Sofia has revealed that the Barcelona star told her he didn't bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup in Brazil - before admitting the truth 10 days later.

"Sheffield Wednesday are ready to offer new contracts to defender Tom Lees and goalkeeper Keiren Westwood. Wednesday equalled their club record of 17 clean sheets in a season on Tuesday night with a 1-0 win over promotion-chasing Brentford. The record has stood since 1978-79 in the days when Jack Charlton was manager. Tom Lees (right) is in line to offered a new deal at Sheffield Wednesday after impressing since joining the club. Lees, who joined last summer from Leeds, has been a key figure and like Westwood is among the contenders for the club's Player of the Year award. He said: 'It would have been a long summer had we not got that clean sheet to equal the club record. It would have been so frustrating because we’ve had so many games to get that one clean sheet.' With three games remaining, naturally, the defender is hoping to go one better. He added: 'Now it would be nice to set a new record. That is our target so we’ll have to see how it goes. The boys who have come in to the back four have done well.

LeGarrette Blount will miss the first game of the new season after being charged with marijuana possession. Former Steeler LeGarrette Blount and a female passenger were also in the car and the pair were charged with marijuana possession. Bell was also charged with a DUI. Blount - who was waived by Pittsburgh, joined the Patriots in November and went on to win the Super Bowl - was banned for the first game of the season earlier this week. Bell plans to appeal the decision, says ESPN's Adam Schefter who broke the story. Bell had 2,215 all-purpose yards, 11 touchdowns and made the All-Pro team last season. The Steelers signed veteran running back DeAngelo Williams in free agency and he looks likely to cover for 23-year-old Bell.'

"The New York Jets have added another former Patriot to their roster in the shape of running back Stevan Ridley. The 26-year-old has signed a one-year deal after suffering a tear to his right ACL last season. He played just six games as the Patriots won their sixth straight AFC East title and went on to win the Super Bowl. 'Sending love to all my day one fans, and every team-mate I've had the pleasure to take the field with,' Ridley posted on Instagram. Stevan Ridley (right) became the 15th player to join the Jets in a frantic free agency. Ridley (right) celebrates the Patriots Super Bowl win during their victory parade in Boston. 'We all know it's a business, yet it's also a blessing. So either way you see it, you'll never understand. 'Love New England, Love my former team-mates and I'm truly thankful for the opportunity the Patriots organisation has blessed me with. However it's #ontotheJETS.' The Jets will hope Ridley reproduces the kind of form he showed in 2012, where he rushed for 1,263 yards and 12 touchdowns.

"Adrian Peterson is to meet with the NFL to discuss his reinstatement. The Minnesota Vikings running back played once last season before being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list due to a child abuse case. The 30-year-old was was due to be reinstated on April 15, but according to NFL media insider Ian Rapoport, Peterson will meet with the NFL this week. Peterson's situation is far from clear, with the 2012 MVP telling ESPN he was 'uneasy' about returning to the franchise. Adrian Peterson has plenty to chew over but the Minnesota Vikings do not want to trade their star back. It has been a turbulent seven months for Peterson, who has been linked with the Cowboys and Cardinals. His main bone of contention  is said to be with chief operating officer Kevin Warren, whom the Peterson camp claims attempted to keep him off the field last year. The Vikings start offseason workouts in a fortnight and head coach Mike Zimmer has repeatedly spoken of his desire for Peterson to stay. 'I'm not going to speculate on what he wants or doesn't want,' Zimmer said last month. 'Adrian's under contract for three more years with us, and that's why you sign those contracts. That's why you get these big bonuses, you know?' 'We have no plans to trade Adrian,' he said, definitively. Peterson is under contract for 2015, and is set to earn a base salary of $12.75million from the Vikings. The Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals are repeatedly linked as potential landing spots and when his status is settled, it will be one step nearer to finding out where his future lies.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Adrian Peterson is to meet with the NFL to discuss his reinstatement.

"The NFL is set to hire Sarah Thomas as its first permanent female official for regular season games, according to reports. The 42-year-old mother-of-three from Mississippi has officiated pre-season games as a line judge. The Baltimore Sun's Aaron Wilson broke the story, with the NFL refusing to confirm the appointment. The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas will be one of eight new officials for the 2015 season. Sarah Thomas is set to become the NFL's first full-time female official after refereeing college games. Thomas was on the NFL's list of officiating prospects and is set to be named as one of eight new officials. Thomas has a history of trailblazing since beginning her refereeing career in 1999. Starting at high school level, she would go on to become the first woman to referee in a Big Ten stadium and a bowl game. 'She has the right temperament and attitude and feel for the game,' a source told The Baltimore Sun. 'She knows the rules and understands how to apply them in the spirit of the rules. That sets her apart, male or female.' 'I set out to do this and get involved in officiating not having any idea that there were not any females officiating football,' Thomas told NFL Network. 'Being a former basketball player, you saw female officiating all the time. So, no, I don't feel like a pioneer.' In 2012, Shannon Eastin was hired during an officiating lockout and was line judge during the regular season game between the Green Bay Packers and the St Louis Rams.

"Boxing fans hoping to attend the weigh-in for the welterweight showdown between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao on May 2 must buy advance tickets. The vast numbers expected to attend the eve-of-fight ritual at the MGM Grand Garden Arena has prompted fight organisers to take the step of charging for entry to the event.

Komen and the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. Floyd Maywetaher is looking to make it 49-0 with a win against the hard-hitting Filipino fighter. 'The weigh-in is always the grand finale of fight week activities,' said Mayweather Promotions chief executive Leonard Ellerbe. 'And with the massive interest in this fight, the number of fans looking to attend the official weigh-in is going to be something we've never seen before. 'We're excited to be able to use the enthusiasm around this event to provide donations to two very deserving charities.' Manny Pacquiao has wanted this fight for years and will be the toughest opponent that Mayweather has faced. A mere 500 tickets were made available to the public for the clash between the two best fighters of their generation.

Working with his caddie in China, Watson pulled off a baseball-style shot with a driver, striking the ball as it was dropped from a height. Bubba Watson showed off an incredible baseball style trick shot while practicing in China. The American flicked the ball to someone in the tree before they dropped it and he smashed it down the middle. And he didn't just trickle it down the fairway, either. Watson's shot seemed to fly down the middle, drawing quite a reaction from his caddie. Watson struggled for form at the Shenzhen International, finishing T-29 at the European Tour event. The American did however, recover after two opening rounds of 74 with a 65 on the final day. Watson finished T-38 at the Masters, despite being one of the favourites to seal a third green jacket in four years. The ball flew straight down the middle, much to the excitement of his friend behind the camera.

Watson finished T-38 at the Masters, despite being one of the favourites to seal a third green jacket in four years. The ball flew straight down the middle, much to the excitement of his friend behind the camera. Watson's form has been poor in recent weeks after a disappointing Masters and Shenzen International.'

"Aviva Premiership club Gloucester will face a Rugby Football Union hearing after selecting lock Mariano Galarza for their league game against Sale Sharks last month. The RFU has said Galarza should have been ineligible for the match. In a statement, the RFU said: 'In the Aviva Premiership rugby match against Sale Sharks on March 29, Gloucester Rugby breached Aviva Premiership Rugby regulation 3.3(a) by selecting a player (Mariano Galarza) who did not hold effective registration for Gloucester Rugby. Mariano Galarza played for Gloucester against Sale Sharks despite the fact that he's ineligible. 'The case will be heard by an independent panel of Jeremy Summers, Bonike Erinle and Robert Horner on Monday, April 27.' Galarza was selected among Gloucester's replacements for a game that they lost 23-6 at the A J Bell Stadium. He went on as a 54th-minute substitute for Tom Savage.

O’Sullivan was hurting, too, after earning his last-16 place — due to the discomfort his shoes were causing him. Ronnie O'Sullivan moved into the second round of the World Snooker Championship on Wednesday. The five-time world champion beat Craig Steadman 10-3 in their first round contest at The Crucible. He might have faced a fine of around £250 for briefly playing on without shoes, but because O’Sullivan was ready to accept any other pair of size eights offered his way, tournament officials decided there was no case of a dress-code breach to answer. The title favourite dug out an old pair of dress shoes for yesterday’s play, as he converted a 7-2 overnight lead, before putting out a call for help. ‘If any top shoemakers feel like they want to come and sort me out with a new pair, send your boys down. I’m not going to say no,’ said O’Sullivan. ‘I’d appreciate a new pair of shoes and I need some help.’ O’Sullivan will face Matthew Stevens in the second round after he beat fellow Welshman Mark Williams 10-2.

O'Sullivan was seen playing in socks on Tuesday and could face a small fine for breach of dress code.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Ronnie O’Sullivan urged Britain’s shoemakers to spare him Crucible agony after getting through three pairs in a chaotic start to his Betfred World Snooker Championship campaign.

Morgan Schneiderlin takes the ball past Stoke's Steven N'Zonzi in Southampton's last game - a 2-1 defeat. The Argentine is returning to St Mary’s for the first time since he signed a five-year deal at Spurs last May. After he left, a swathe of key players followed and the place was shrouded in uncertainty about the season ahead.

They also have the right, yet to be exercised, to appoint two directors to the board. That deal also saw Ashley's firm take a 75 per cent grip of the Rangers Retail subsidiary, increasing their stranglehold over merchandising income.

Mayweather with SubZero owner David Levi who is also one of the boxer's many assistants. The boxer was the first person to use the bath in SubZero Recovery in Las Vegas. 'It tricks your body into thinking you're going into hypothermia,' owner David Levi told Sports Illustrated. 'So it sends blood from your arms and legs into your core. That blood picks up enzymes and oxygen and nutrients, and as you jump out, it circulates back through your body.' Levi, who is also one of Mayweather's assistants, also revealed to TMZ that his boss calls him at three or four in the morning to use the machine, called a Cryosauna, which cost him $60,000 (£40,000). Cryotherapy is a growing trend in sports with the Wales rugby team travelling to Poland for sessions in 2012 before building their own chamber in Cardiff.

"Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis will miss three to four weeks with a hamstring injury. Gomis came off in the early stages of last weekend's 1-1 Barclays Premier League home draw with Everton and scans have now revealed the full extent of the damage. The Frenchman will miss league trips to Leicester and Newcastle and the home game with Stoke but hopes to return for the visit to Arsenal on May 11. 'Scans this week revealed a grade two hamstring strain which will keep the French international sidelined for around three to four weeks,' said a statement on the official Swansea website. Swansea's Bafetimbi Gomis unleashes a dangerous shot but only manages to injure his hamstring. Gomis's injury, a grade two hamstring strain, will keep him off the pitch for three to four weeks. Gomis' injury has come at the worst possible time as he was finding his best form in a Swansea shirt after a difficult first season at the Liberty Stadium. The 29-year-old spent the first half of the campaign in Wilfried Bony's shadow and appeared to be agitating for a move until the Ivorian was sold to Manchester City in January for an initial £25million fee. But Gomis, who joined from Lyon on a free transfer last summer, has since settled at Swansea and had scored four goals in seven games before being injured against Everton. Loan signing Nelson Oliveira and Marvin Emnes will compete to fill Gomis' spot at Leicester on Saturday. Gomis had scored four in his last seven matches after excelling since Wilfried Bony's departure.

"Keeping David de Gea at the club would be the biggest signing Manchester United could make this summer, says Phil Neville. The Spanish keeper has impressed for Louis van Gaal's side this season and has heavily been linked with a move to Real Madrid, who are looking for a long-term replacement for Iker Casillas. United have been linked with their own big-money moves for the likes of Gareth Bale and Mats Hummels, but Neville believes the club must concentrate on keeping De Gea at Old Trafford. David de Gea met Man United fans earlier in the week as part of a day organised by the club's foundation. De Gea punches the ball away during Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. 'The biggest thing is David De Gea, and keeping him at the football club,' Neville told the Manchester Evening News.

"With two weeks to go until Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao finally get in the ring, it seems no-one is immune to being caught up in the hype. With the fight set to gross more than $300million, it is certain to be the biggest in the history of the sport. And even Sky Sports pundits Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry are getting involved as they went face-to-face in the studio. Scroll down for video. Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry face off in anticipation of Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao. Redknapp attempts to goad Henry into a reaction in the early stages as the Arsenal legend stays cool. But both men collapse into giggles as they struggle to maintain the mock tension between them. Redknapp says: 'My friend Thierry Henry thinks he can beat me in a head-to-head.

The Greek government has put forward a bill which could see sporting events cancelled due to incidents of crowd violence and teams prohibited from playing in European competition.

'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football. 'Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team.

"Sir Oliver Popplewell, the judge who conducted the 1985 Bradford fire public inquiry, says police should look at eight other fires allegedly connected to the then club chairman to 'see if there was anything sinister'. A new book claims the fire at Bradford's Valley Parade stadium was one of at least nine blazes at businesses owned by or associated with the club's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who died in 1995. Popplewell's inquiry concluded that the cause was an accident probably started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand. The tragic fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985. Sir Oliver Popplewell (centre), the judge who conducted the 1985 inquiry into the fire, says police should look at eight other fires allegedly connected to the then club chairman to 'see if there was anything sinister'. He stands by the original ruling saying there was no evidence of arson. But he said: 'I don't think it's going to affect what we decided but I think it is important from a public point of view that the police look at the other fires and see if there was anything sinister. It is a remarkable number. 'I think it's important to satisfy people's minds that the other fires are unconnected.' The tragic fire at Valley Parade killed 56 people and injured at least 265 after it broke out during a Football League Third division match against Lincoln City on Saturday, May 11, 1985.

"Negotiations to make a fight between Paul Smith and Andre Ward are set to be concluded this week, with the Liverpool super-middleweight set to meet one of boxing's biggest talents on June 20. Sportsmail understands discussions are virtually finalised for the summer showdown, with a formal announcement of the fight expected imminently. Elements of the deal are still being rubber-stamped and Ward’s WBA world title is unlikely to be on the line. However, the fight, which will be staged in Oakland, California, will run over the 12-round distance. Liverpool boxer Paul Smith (left) is in line to take on Andre Ward on June 20. Ward (right) has won all of his 24 bouts but has not fought since defeating Edwin Rodriguez in November. It is a huge opportunity for Smith but an even bigger task against a fighter who outclassed Carl Froch in 2011. Smith, 32, has lost back-to-back world title challenges in Germany against Arthur Abraham, albeit in controversial circumstances in the first of those fights when a wide decision was handed to Abraham from a close bout. Smith has lost his last two world title challenges to Arthur Abraham (left) of Germany. Ward defeated Carl Froch in 2011 and could be set for a rematch if he beats Smith. Smith's hope this time round will be that Ward, usually so slick and brilliantly accurate, has diminished through inactivity. The 31-year-old, an Olympic champion and winner of all 27 of his professional fights, has not fought since November 2013. That period of absence will add a fascinating dimension to a fight that will catch the attention of Froch, who would postpone retirement for a home rematch against Ward.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Negotiations to make a fight between Paul Smith and Andre Ward are set to be concluded this week, with the Liverpool super-middleweight set to meet one of boxing's biggest talents on June 20.

"Young women no longer compare themselves to celebrities in glossy magazines but fret about how they look on Facebook instead, according to a study. They use pictures on the social networking site to gauge their own appearance and see how they measure up against friends. Facebook consumes 40 per cent of the time young women spend online, psychologists at the University of New South Wales in Australia found. Comparison site: A study found women compared themselves to their friends on Facebook rather than celebrities in magazines. The study, of 150 college students and staff aged 17 to 25, found they read magazines ‘infrequently’ but checked Facebook every few hours. The women preferred Facebook as a means of judging themselves because they could compare their looks with peers similar to them and see how they had changed over time. The research comes the same week as an Australian mother received a poison pen letter from a Facebook friend because of her regular updates about her baby daughter. Jade Ruthven, 33, from Perth, was told she was  'p*****g a lot of people off' with her constant statuses about daughter Addison. Measuring up: Women aged 17 to 25 were found to judge themselves alongside pictures of friends rather than celebrities in magazines. She got her own back on the unidentified 'friends' by forwarding it onto comedian Em Rusciano - who shared it with her thousands of followers on social media. Writing in the journal Psychology Of Women Quarterly, researcher Jasmine Fardouly advised women at risk of low self-esteem to post fewer pictures of themselves online and avoid following people who upload them too frequently.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Young women no longer compare themselves to celebrities in glossy magazines but fret about how they look on Facebook instead, according to a study.

You call that muscle?: This man was quick to show his guns on the Flex Cam on April 12. About to get flexy: This unidentified woman removed her jacket to show this man what real muscles are. The Flex Cam is a stadium tradition in which a camera rolls around the audience so that they can display their muscles. In this particular Flex Cam a woman in the seats held back for a while contemplating whether or not to strut her stuff. She can be seen seated and wearing a denim jacket and laughing when a man in front of her shows his chicken cutlet of a muscle. The woman then makes then the decision to stand up, remove her jacket and reveal her protruding muscles right in his face. The man, feeling a bit defeated, then slumps back into his chair. That's what you call muscle: This woman flexes her gigantic muscles for all to see. In your face: In case the man in front of her could not see her huge muscles she gave him a closer look.

"Jacques Burger will be available to play in Saracens' European Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont Auvergne in Saint Etienne on April 18. The Namibia flanker received a one-week ban after he appeared at a Champions Cup disciplinary hearing on Thursday.

Announcing the verdict, European Professional Club Rugby said: 'The independent judicial officer Simon Thomas (Wales) heard submissions and evidence from Burger, who pleaded guilty to the offence, from Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall and from the Saracens team manager JP O'Reilly. 'Submissions and evidence were also presented by the tournament disciplinary officer. 'In upholding the citing complaint, the judicial officer determined that the offence was reckless and warranted a red card, and that it was at the low end (two weeks) of World Rugby's sanctions for offences of this nature.

West Brom (home) - May 2. Crystal Palace (away) - May 9. Arsenal (home) - May 16. Hull (away) - May 24. 'We have to wait and see how heavy (serious) it is,' the United boss said.

"Chelsea were forced to substitute Oscar during the derby against Arsenal after their creative midfielder suffered 'possible concussion' in the first half. The Brazilian collided with an onrushing David Ospina in the 16th minute at the Emirates Stadium and was sent to hospital at half time for checks. It looked as if the Arsenal goalkeeper had given away a penalty, but referee Michael Oliver waved away Chelsea's protestation following the painful clash. Oscar was clattered into by Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina during Sunday's London derby. Sky Sports revealed that Jose Mourinho said the Brazilian was taken off due to 'possible concussion' Oscar was knocked back by the goalkeeper but Michael Oliver didn't award Chelsea a penalty. Didier Drogba replaced Oscar at the break, with Sky Sports revealing that Jose Mourinho had told them the decision was taken because of concussion concerns over the latter. It means Oscar played on for half an hour before being properly assessed, potentially bringing the concussion debate into the public domain again. 'He went to the hospital at halftime,' Mourinho said. 'We are waiting. We don't know yet (if it's concussion).' Television pundits Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness and Thierry Henry were all in agreement that it should have been a penalty. Carragher said: 'It was a definitely penalty. It could even be a red card.’ Henry said: 'The adrenalin will sometimes bring you back to the field. Maybe he thought he could not go back on after sitting in the dressing room for 15 minutes.’ Oscar appeared in a bad way immediately after being poleaxed by the Gunners' goalkeeper. He attempted to get up but his arms fell back down to the turf in direct response to the hit. The collision was in the 16th minute but Oscar still manage to play on until half-time.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Chelsea were forced to substitute Oscar during the derby against Arsenal after their creative midfielder suffered 'possible concussion' in the first half.

"Arsenal Fan TV favourite Claude Callegari may well have been speaking for a number of Gunners fans when demanding for the Cesc Fabregas flag to be taken down from the side of the Emirates Stadium.

"Oldham Athletic have signed Ronaldo. But fans of Manchester United fear not - the League One club have not snaffled their old boy from the mighty Real Madrid. The man in question is 16-year-old Ronaldo Brown who has joined the Latics after being released by Liverpool. Like his namesake, the teenager has explosive pace and plays on the wing. Ronaldo Brown (left), pictured on tour of the Nou Camp in Barcelona, has signed for Oldham Athletic. The 16-year-old  is named after Brazil's former striker Ronaldo, who is pictured scoring in the 2002 World Cup. But he is actually named after the original Brazilian Ronaldo, rather than Portugal star Cristiano. Football-mad mum Denise, 38, chose the name because of her love of the Brazil side - and added that Ronaldo has a twin brother called Rivaldo. Denise, from Fallowfield, Manchester, explained: 'I love football and the boys were born in 1998 - the year of the World Cup. I liked the Brazil side so I named them after Ronaldo and Rivaldo. 'They also have a younger sister called Trezeguet after the French player (David).' Long-suffering Oldham fans, whose team has remained in League One for 18 years, can look forward to one day seeing Ronaldo strutting his stuff at Boundary Park.

Such was the fate of two window cleaners working at a skyscraper in Shanghai recently, People’s Daily Online reported, with their ordeal filmed from inside the building by an onlooker. The incident occurred at the 91st floor of the 101-storey Shanghai World Financial Centre, the city’s second-tallest building at 492 metres (1,614ft). The one-minute video shows the platform swing violently in wind with the Lujiazui Financial District hundreds of metres below. The platform can be heard striking the windows of the building repeatedly, and at least two panes of glass cracked due to the force of the impact with shards falling on to the street below. Terrifying: Two window cleaners had a ride of their life after their platform was blown around by high winds. Astonishingly, the two workers who were stuck in the platform only suffered minor injuries. Authorities said they were investigating the incident.

"Daniel Levy reportedly told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust that after the problems reinvesting the money received for Gareth Bale, future transfer policy would entail the purchase of young players, priced between £10-15million with good potential for resale. This may be financially sensible, but it is hardly reassuring. Elite clubs, those who challenge for the biggest trophies, do not buy with one eye on selling and this strategy would set Tottenham back a decade to a time when they helped solve problems at Manchester United by trading top performers such as Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov. Indeed, the only time Tottenham demonstrated real Champions League potential was when Levy resisted the likes of Chelsea over Luka Modric. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is planning a new transfer policy for the club that centres on resale value. Spurs sold forward Gareth Bale (left) to Real Madrid in 2013 for a world-record £85 million transfer fee. Spurs' best chance of securing regular Champions League football came when Luka Modric played for them. Spurs allowed star performers Dimitar Berbatov (left) and Michael Carrick (right) to join Manchester United. The moment they started to sell again, Tottenham fell away.

"Children are known to copy the actions of their parents. And one adorable little girl has mastered a brilliant impression of her pregnant mother. Captured in a 15-second clip, the youngster emulates the way her pregnant mother walks - and the result is hilarious. The 15-month-old girl arches her back and pushes out her belly while strutting around the room. The youngster pulls a cheeky face while her father also mimics the mum's pregnant walk in the background. The clip begins with mum, American Teri O'Neil, 30, asking 15-month-old Olivia: ‘How does mama walk?’ while filming at her home. Suddenly the youngster appears from the side of the shot and with her back bent and tummy pushed forward she struts past. She pulls a cheeky face as she continues around the room – in the background her father can be seen emulating the walk with her.

And one adorable little girl has mastered a brilliant impression of her pregnant mother. Captured in a 15-second clip, the youngster emulates the way her pregnant mother walks - and the result is hilarious. The 15-month-old girl arches her back and pushes out her belly while strutting around the room. The youngster pulls a cheeky face while her father also mimics the mum's pregnant walk in the background. The clip begins with mum, American Teri O'Neil, 30, asking 15-month-old Olivia: ‘How does mama walk?’ while filming at her home. Suddenly the youngster appears from the side of the shot and with her back bent and tummy pushed forward she struts past. She pulls a cheeky face as she continues around the room – in the background her father can be seen emulating the walk with her.

"A taxi driver channelled his inner Pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers. The Uber driver was filmed by passengers as he sang along to a radio broadcast while driving in Boston, America. At first the driver lets the radio take command and Pavarotti’s distinctive voice can be heard from within side the cab. At first the driver lets the radio play before he begins singing along to the Pavarotti song in perfect tune. He then begins singing along himself – loudly so that he is audible above the radio and the sounds of the road. While looking around as he drives, the Uber worker continues to sing along to the song both in tune and word perfectly. The song then concludes with the video maker saying: ‘Wow’ and the taxi driver falling silent as the outro music plays. The passenger filming then says: ‘Wow, that was brilliant. Thank you very much.’ He then asks whether the man was singing along to Pavarotti, to which the driver says yes. Reality is then restored as the passenger finishes praising the driver and instructs him to keep going straight. The passengers are amazed as they film the driver who sings along   to the opera song word perfectly. Later, the film maker wrote: ‘We were heading out to meet some friends at a party in South Boston and had a wonderful journey with the Uber Opera Man.’ Luciano Pavarotti was one of the most commercially successful tenors of all time and one of the Three Tenors. Gaining worldwide fame for the tone of his voice, Pavarotti made a number of televised concert performances. In 2007, the tenor died from pancreatic cancer.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A taxi driver channelled his inner Pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers.

"This is the dramatic moment a brave village watchman fought off a wild leopard armed with only a stick in India. The incident took place in Olani village, four kilometres from Manpur, in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops. To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him. Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws. Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick. After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off. He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter. In last year's Indian elections, rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting. The dramatic incident recorded by a terrified onlooker took place in Olani village, in central India.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'This is the dramatic moment a brave village watchman fought off a wild leopard armed with only a stick in India.

And, hot on the heels of Ronda Rousey, the UFC may just have its next female superstar. Herrig and VanZant grapple in their one-sided women's strawweight bout. Herrig struggled to impose herself on the fight despite having much more experience.' Provide only the summary as the response.",ba6709edbcac495db3aa8ecbdc45f0c1
"They say every cloud has a silver lining, but not every cloud has an outline like this one. A Northern Territory mother was lost for words after she spotted a phallic cloud on a work break last week. Labourer Noeleen Foster was thrilled to capture the suggestively shaped formation above Zuccoli -25km southeast from Darwin - on Friday morning. A phallic shaped cloud which appeared last week in Zuccoli, 25km southeast of Darwin. The mother of-four told Daily Mail Australia she snapped the pornographic precipitation from the civil construction site where she works. 'I was pretty shocked when I saw it. I couldn't believe my eyes - it seems even mother nature has a sense of humour!' Ms Foster was alone for the break but she's sure somebody else in the area must have recognised the X-rated cloud. The Palmerston resident said she loves the clouds and often photographs them, but she's never come across one shaped like this. Labourer Noeleen Foster (right) said she couldn't believe her eyes when she spotted the suggestively shaped cloud. Not the first: This famous phallic cloud was captured by a nature photographer last year in Debyshire, central England. It's not the first natural phallic phenomenon though: last June, a 48-year-old nature photographer captured another famous penis cloud which made waves online. 'Villager Jim,' who chose not to give his full name, snapped the naughty cloud in Debyshire, central England. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw it over my house.

Manchester City striker Natasha Flint bagged a first-half hat-trick as the Young Lions squad came from a goal down to secure an impressive victory at Seaview. However, Saturday's defeat to Norway could yet prove costly as England can now only make it to this summer's finals in Israel as best-placed runners up. Manchester City's Natasha Flint bagged a hat-trick as the Young Lions squad came from goal down to win. The night started badly for Mo Marley's side as they found themselves a goal behind with just ten minutes played in Belfast as Aimee Mackin's gave the hosts the advantage. But five goals in 13 minutes ensured England left victorious. England were level with 27 minutes of the game gone as Chelsea midfielder Jodie Brett found the back of the net before Flint grabbed her first goal of the game. City striker Flint scored her second and third goals of the game in between two Leah Williamson penalties. It was 7-1 with less than 60 minutes of the game gone as Sarah Mayling and Katie Zelem got themselves on the score sheet. Williamson duly converted her second penalty of the match when Amy McGivern saw red and substitute Millie Turner capped off a sensational performance when she grabbed England's ninth in added time.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'England Women's Under 19s smashed Northern Ireland 9-1 to keep their dreams of Euro qualification very much alive.

"An American woman proved that she is no arachnophobe when she posed with her rather snappy pet tarantula and allowed it to bite her hand. Footage shows exotic pet owner Kayonna Cole holding her female rose hair spider up to the camera as it digs its fangs into her skin. Kayonna, who filmed the moment at her home in Los Angeles, remains calm throughout the video, but later suffered a reaction to the spider's venom. Kayonna holds her hand steady and remains calm as the tarantula removes its fangs from her skin. Clearly visible are the tarantula’s fangs, which it immediately begins to use to pinch away at Kayonna’s hand. Unflinching, Kayonna holds her hand steady as the tarantula removes its fangs from her skin and tucks them in slightly. Later in the video the spider begins pinching her once more and even appears to puncture the surface of her skin. Kayonna bravely holds her female rose hair spider up to the camera while it demonstrates its biting action. But once again the spider's owner remains remarkably calm and holds her hand still for the spider. Kayonna wrote online that the tarantula was showing aggression or possibly testing her fangs. She wrote: ‘Her bites were not painful, the after effects from the venom were more painful with the symptoms being slight redness of the skin surrounding the bites, soreness and itching. ‘This species of tarantula has low toxicity venom similar to that of a bee sting.'

"All eyes will be on AP McCoy as he bids for a dream end to his career but I have a strong feeling that a horse he could have ridden is going to come back to haunt him. The 19-time champion jockey could have ridden Cause of Causes who, like his mount Shutthefrontdoor, is owned by his boss JP McManus. He has ridden him three times before. While it was ultimately no surprise he chose Shutthefrontdoor, a runner with strong credentials, Cause of Causes also has very good reasons why he should be backed. Cause of Causes at Cheltenham last month. He was second at the 2014 Cheltenham Festival and then landed the four-mile National Hunt Chase at last month’s meeting. That marks him down as a quality performer, and he is ridden by a Grand National winning jockey in Paul Carberry (Bobbyjo, 1999) and trained by a race-winning trainer in Gordon Elliott (Silver Birch, 2007).

"For the first time since in 100 years, Arsenal will not start the season at the summit of England's top-flight, following the effective promotion of Bournemouth on Monday. The Cherries official name is AFC Bournemouth, meaning their name would start ahead of Arsenal's by virtue of the alphabet when the embryonic table is compiled upon the announcement of next season's fixtures. The Goldsands Stadium, home of AFC Bournemouth, will host Premier League football next season. Bournemouth's promotion means Arsenal will start season in second place for the first time in 100 years. Arsenal have theoretically started each season since 1915/16 at the summit of England's top tier, although the advent of the First World War meant it was only in 1919 that the club officially began their century-old record. The Gunners only finished fifth in the last pre-war competitive season, but they were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division after the First World War in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals Tottenham. After Eddie Howe guided Bournemouth to within touching distance of the Promised Land on Monday with victory over Bolton, only a highly improbable goal-swing would deny them automatic promotion. As a result, Arsenal will begin next season second in the Premier League before a ball is kicked, behind the south coast club by a full 12 letters.

"Francis Coquelin has jumped to the defence of team-mate Olivier Giroud following Thierry Henry's claim that Arsenal need a 'top quality striker' to win the Premier League next season. Despite Giroud scoring 14 Premier League goals for Arsene Wenger's side this campaign, Henry believes he must sign a new striker as well as three more players if they are to compete for the title. Speaking after the 0-0 draw with Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday, Henry told Sky Sports: 'They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again.' Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin has defended Olivier Giroud (above) after criticism from Thierry Henry. Sky Sports pundit Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Giroud in attack. Coquelin, who has played a vital role in Arsenal's late-season resurgence, has since hit back at the Gunners legend and insists Giroud is worthy of his place in the first team. The French midfielder told RMC: 'Thierry Henry is wrong. Giroud shows his potential every week. 'He showed that he has the level to be the Arsenal striker and we can win titles with him. 'We are disappointed with the result against Chelsea because we were on a good run.

"A canal bank beneath a busy flyover might not rank as paradise. But for this puzzled puffin – apparently suffering a navigation malfunction and pining for the Atlantic – it was welcome sanctuary. The confused bird was seen swimming in the Grand Union canal earlier this month after apparently flying into London along the Thames. This puzzled puffin was spotted flying into London along the Thames, close to the A4 flyover at Brentford. The distinctive bird with an orange beak was spotted by an eagle-eyed canal boat resident. The puffin was given some fish and wrapped in a blanket, before being handed to a specialist centre  in Dorset to recuperate. More commonly seen in Iceland and the North Atlantic, it was spotted near the A4 flyover at Brentford. Its holiday came to an end when a canal-boat resident caught sight of its distinctive beak and alerted the appropriate authorities. Steve Knight, of the Swan Sanctuary in nearby Shepperton, caught the bird, which has now been handed over to a specialist centre in Dorset, where he is being nursed back to full health. ‘I’ve never rescued a puffin before but these birds dive very quickly so you’ve got to be quick about it,’ he said.‘.

"A  photographer captured an intimidating site as he parachuted off the coast of south Florida last week. Photographer John Massung was flying over Sebastian Inlet on Thursday when he saw hundreds of sharks swarming just 100 feet from the beach. Massung says he flew for about a mile down the shore and that the hordes of sharks never ended. A fellow photographer was even further out and saw the same scene. Worst nightmare: A swarm of sharks was spotted off the coast of south Florida last Thursday. Stay out of the water: When the following pictures were posted to Facebook, users theorized that the swarm was a mix of Blacktip and Spinner sharks. Swarm: Blacktip and Spinner sharks migrate each year to breed in shallower waters. 'It looked like they had traveling in mind. They were heading north,' Massung told NBC Miami. Since he wasn't certain what kind of shark was gathering south of the inlet, Massung posted the photos to the Indian River by Air Facebook page to see if any experts could offer some enlightenment. Most responded that the sharks looked like either Blacktips or Spinners, which migrate this time of year to breed. The picture had been shared more than 2,000 times by Sunday. Massung says the sharks were still out in the water on Friday, but the conditions weren't clear enough to photograph the scene. Hunting grounds: Above, a stock image of a Blacktip shark, one of the species of shark thought to be seen in the pictures taken Thursday near Sebastian Inlet.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A  photographer captured an intimidating site as he parachuted off the coast of south Florida last week.

"This is the amazing scene as a freelance photographer risks his life to capture an image of a hungry lion from just a few feet away. Fearless Atif Saeed, 38, from Lahore, Pakistan was in the city's safari park when he spotted the male lion in the distance. Mr Saeed got out of his car and crept up towards the hunter armed only with a camera and fired off a few frames. Atif Saeed crept to within 10 feet of the hungry lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground. Armed only with a camera, Mr Saeed, managed to capture a couple of frames before retreating to safety. Unfortunately, the clicking sound of the camera's shutter alerted the lion to Mr Saeed's presence, who was forced to retreat quite rapidly from just 10 feet away from the lion. He said: 'I was sitting in front of him just near my car and the door of my car was open. I was sat on ground few feet away, so he was treating me like his prey. 'I was thinking - I must show the character and status of lion and this was the only way I could think of to achieve this. 'The story finished in few seconds as the lion aggressively jumped towards me and I just about scrambled into my car.

He has decided that for his next fight he will make sure someone pats him down. Referee Frankie Santore Jr. went over to pick up the Samsung Galaxy and looked like he was chastising Jones. Jones, 32, held his hands up as the referee took the phone over to the side of the ring.

"A bomb technician has used his expertise to create an Easter egg hunt for blind children - using beeping eggs. David Hyche, now a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), developed the technology nine years ago when his four-month-old daughter turned blind. A transmitter is placed inside plastic eggs that let off a high-pitched beeping sound. Now Hyche has passed on the idea to the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Birmingham. Festive invention: Blind children in Birmingham, Alabama, have celebrated Easter early by hunting for plastic eggs that let of a beeping sound. They trade the eggs in for candy. The device: Bomb expert David Hyche put a transmitter in a plastic egg so his daughter could join the fun. 'With my daughter, one of her first phrases was, 'I do it myself.' She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too,' he told WBRC. 'It's logical for people who are explosives investigators. It's just a battery, beeper and a switch... pretty simple.' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy.

"Beach-goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at Victoria's picturesque Rye Beach last week - a swimming echidna! The prickly Australian mammal was filmed paddling out to sea in the turquoise waters off the Mornington Peninsula, 83 km south of Melbourne. Where it was heading, is anyone's guess. Scroll down for video. This echidna was spotted paddling out to sea off Rye Beach, a popular surfing and fishing spot on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. The video of the swimming echidna, which looks to be happily using its ant-eating snout as a snorkel, was posted online by YouTube user Emma B. According to Australia Zoo, echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers. They like the water so much, that the Zoo built a special  swimming pool for its echidna residents to cool off on hot summer days. Echidnas, like many native Australian animals, are actually 'proficient' swimmers - though they usually prefer fresh water to the open ocean. The echidna - or spiny ant-eater - is  found all over Australia, in coastal forests, alpine meadows and desert habitats. They live on a diet of ants, termites, grubs and worms but biologists think the mammals evolved from aquatic ancestors like the platypus. Gary Sutton, a park ranger from Narawntapu National Park in Tasmania, said he has also seen  wallabies and wombats surfing. He previously told the ABC he thought the animals went in the water to get rid of parasites, like lice and ticks. With its webbed-feet and snout in the air as a snorkle, the little echidna paddled out to sea.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Beach-goers were faced with a different kind of sea creature when they entered the water at Victoria's picturesque Rye Beach last week - a swimming echidna!

"The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday. While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday. The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008. In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday.

"A New York man was indicted Wednesday on multiple charges after allegedly strangling a relative's dog and bragging about it afterward. Police say Edward Nudel, 41, of Staten Island broke into his relative's home on March 11 and strangled a 2-year-old Pomeranian named Lola 'in an especially depraved and sadistic manner,' SILive reports. Nudel and the relative reportedly had an argument and, after strangling the dog, he called the relative and said 'I killed Lola.' Bragging: Edward Nudel, 41 (photographed), was indicted Wednesday on multiple charges after allegedly strangling a relative's dog and bragging about it afterward. Police were called and arrived at Nudel's Bay Terrace home to find him sleeping in his bed with Lola lying motionless on the floor nearby with her tongue out, sources told SILive. 'Am I getting arrested for a f***ing dog?' Nudel reportedly said when officers woke him to take him into custody. Nudel, who reportedly appeared intoxicated, wrestled with the cops, according to the New York Daily News reports, kicking one officer in the upper body. Pomeranian: Photographed is a Pomeranian who lives at the residence where Lola was allegedly killed. The officer had to undergo treatment at the Staten Island University Hospital. The dog was taken to an animal hospital where she was pronounced dead, SILive reports. She was taken to the ASPCA for a necropsy; the initial indication is that she was strangled to death. Nudel is facing a slew of charges including felony counts of assault and aggravated cruelty to animals, misdemeanor counts of overdriving, assault, obstruction, torturing and injuring animals, resisting arrests, and lesser counts of harassment. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment last month, the Daily News reports, and is being held on $25,000 bail.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A New York man was indicted Wednesday on multiple charges after allegedly strangling a relative's dog and bragging about it afterward.

"Weight gain: Pope Francis has been told to cut down on the pasta by doctors. The Pope has been told by doctors that he must lose weight, it has been reported. Vatican medics told Francis to cut his pasta intake to two servings a week and take a daily walk, like his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI did. They are concerned about the sedentary lifestyle of the 78-year-old Catholic leader – who spends much of his time hard at work at his desk or in meetings – as well as his considerable weight gain since he took office two years ago, sources told Italian news agency ANSA. The Pope’s weight is thought to be aggravating his sciatica, a nerve condition which causes back pain. Francis himself has suggested that he does not expect to live to an old age. Two weeks ago he told Mexican TV he did not think his papacy would last long. And on a plane back from South Korea last summer he said that his reign would only last ‘a short time, two or three years and then… to the house of the Father.’ Now doctors have told the Catholic leader that he must shed a few pounds as the extra weight is making his sciatica worse, especially when combined with his intense travel schedule. But the pope who reacted by joking refers to himself as ‘the undisciplined one’ is taking little heed of their warning, continuing to tuck into a bowl of pasta every day. More walks: The Pope arrived on his popemobile at St Peter's Square for his general audience yesterday. He is being encouraged to take more walks in a bid to improve health.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Weight gain: Pope Francis has been told to cut down on the pasta by doctors.

"Former Barcelona and Brazil forward Ronaldinho marked a late cameo in Queretaro's surprise 4-0 thumping of Club America with a brace. The 2002 World Cup winner came on as the game approached full-time but still struck in the 85th and 90th minutes following earlier goals from Yasser Corona, who struck midway through the first half, and Orbelin Pineda's on the stroke of half-time. Tigres Monterrey moved up to fourth in the Clausura after eventually easing to a 3-0 home victory over Monterrey. Queretaro playmaker Ronaldinho celebrates during his side's emphatic 4-0 win over Club America. Ronaldinho (centre) rolled back the years by scoring two goals in quick succession during the Liga MX match.

Lugo Aranda's 56th-minute goal put the home side in front but it was not until the closing stages when they put the game to bed. Rafael Sobis doubled Tigres' lead in the 83rd minute before substitute Esqueda Tirado added gloss to the scoreline four minutes later, scoring almost immediately after coming off the bench. Carlos Pena's 77th-minute effort rescued a 1-1 draw for second-bottom Leon against Toluca, who had taken the lead shortly after half-time through Wilder Guisao. Christian Suarez struck just before half-time as Atlas edged to a 1-0 win at Puebla, who had Acosta Alvarado sent off in the 82nd minute.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Former Barcelona and Brazil forward Ronaldinho marked a late cameo in Queretaro's surprise 4-0 thumping of Club America with a brace.

"The majority of Americans identify as 'middle class'. But what does it actually mean? Crunching the numbers, a new study by Pew Charitable Trusts has revealed the exact salary you need to qualify in each state. Maryland's middle class is the highest paid in the country, with an average income of $72,483. Alaska is second with $72,237, followed by New Jersey with $70,165. The top five is completed by Hawaii and the District of Columbia, where middle class citizens are paid an average higher than $67,500. With an average income of $37,963, Mississippi's middle class is the lowest paid in the country. It is followed by Arkansas with $40,511, West Virginia with $41,253, Alabama with $42,849, and Kentucky with $43,399. New York - home to the financial capital of the United States, New York City - falls 17th in the table. The lowest paid middle class citizen in New York earns $38,246 and the highest paid takes an annual salary of $114,738. The average is $57,369. In California, 11th on the table, the average middle class income is $60,190, with a lower limit of $40,127 and an upper limit of $120,380. According to the study, published on March 19, America's middle class has shrunk significantly in the wake of the financial crisis.

"This is the unfortunate moment a twelve tonne double decker bus broke down - and was pushed to safety by the driver and a group of helpful passengers. The massive bus broke down en route to the Stagecoach depot in Dover, Kent, so the unlucky driver was forced to ask passengers, colleagues and locals to give him a helping hand. Around seven proactive members of the public and bus company workers teamed up and managed to move the heavy bus - which weighs the same as two fully-grown African elephants. The 12-tonne double decker bus (pictured) broke down on its way to the Stagecoach depot in Dover, Kent - and the unlucky driver was forced to ask passengers, colleagues and locals to give him a helping hand. The group managed to succesfully roll the huge bus - which can carry up to 80 passengers - through the streets and on to the local depot. The moment was captured by Dover resident Stephen Davies last week. Mr Davies, 57, said: 'It broke down at the traffic lights but fortunately it was only around the corner from the bus depot so all the drivers came round to push it back. 'A few passengers got out to help too.'

"A Louisiana volunteer police officer was arrested Saturday night after allegedly drunkenly stealing a patrol boat and taking it for a joy ride that ended when he crashed into a riverside bar and grill. Danny Eckhart was intoxicated, his former co-workers in St. Tammany Parish say, when he took the vessel out on the Tchefuncte River and smashed it into pilings outside the T-Rivers Bar in Madisonville. No one was injured in the crash. However, Eckhart faces charges of unauthorized use of a vehicle and operating a vehicle while intoxicated.

"A wallaby has been caught on camera delivering a swift jab to an unsuspecting wombat who invaded his personal space while he was grazing in a Victorian National Park. Shocked onlookers started filming the native pair at the Wilsons Promontory National Park, in the Gippsland region in southeast Victoria, as the wombat waddled over to the unsuspecting wallaby. Scroll down for video. Sucker punch: A wallaby shocked on lookers as he 'punched' a wombat who approached him while he was grazing. In a performance you would expect from a boxing kangaroo, the wallaby turned around and gave the wombat a little crack on the nose after it seemingly got a little too close for comfort. Onlookers were shocked by the actions of the wallaby but it looks like there's no bad blood between the two native Australian's as they both continued happily grazing in the area straight after the encounter. The wombat had no idea what he was in for as he approached the unsuspecting wallaby. Unlike this encounter, wallabies typically use their strong hind legs to deliver a powerful kick when they are feeling threatened. Wilsons Promontory National Park is home to a range of wildlife including kangaroos, emus, echidnas and numerous other smaller marsupials. The wildlife there has become quite accustomed to human presence and animals will often approach people or enter tents looking for food. Make sure you remember that it's illegal to feed wildlife in the national park and if you're caught could be slapped with a fine by park rangers.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A wallaby has been caught on camera delivering a swift jab to an unsuspecting wombat who invaded his personal space while he was grazing in a Victorian National Park.

Lori Smith filmed her pooch Boomer being repeatedly hit as she lay with her head resting on the ledge of her electronic dog door.

"J.B. Silverthorn got charged with a DUI moments after being convicted for his first on Monday. A 44-year-old man got charged with a DUI moments after being convicted for his first, after allegedly turning up to court drunk and driving away. Police say they repeatedly told J.B. Silverthorn of Orchard Park, New York, to not drive home from Grand Island Town Court on Monday night after they noticed he 'smelled of alcohol' and was 'intoxicated'. But the suspect reportedly proceeded to get in his car and pull out of the parking lot before being stopped by deputies. Silverthorn was charged with felony DUI, meaning he could serve a minimum of one year in jail. He was also booked for driving without headlights. He's currently being held in the Erie County jail with his bail set at $1,000. It couldn't be determined if he has a lawyer. Silverthorn was deemed guilty this week for driving over the limit and crashing his car into the Niagara River on December 29. He was stranded three-feet deep in moving water and rescued by firefighters. He's due back in court Monday for a felony hearing. However, if he posts bail, the date could be pushed back to April 22.

"Carefree: Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol Monday night in Dummerston, Vermont. This mugshot certainly won't be winning any points with the judge. Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested on Monday for drunk driving and decided to stick out her tongue when she was brought to Vermont State Police barracks for booking. Police say the woman from Shelburne, Massachusetts was driving drunk around 10:30pm when she ran off Route 5 in Dummerston, Vermont and crashed her 2011 Toyota Camry into a wooden fence. At the scene, MacDonald told responding officers that she crashed while talking on the phone and trying to take directions down on a legal note pad in her car. But when officers smelled alcohol on MacDonald, they administered a breathalyzer test and she posted a .10 blood-alcohol content - above the state's legal threshold of .08. MacDonald stuck out her tongue for the cheeky picture after she was arrested and brought back to police headquarters on charges of driving while intoxicated. Police say that though MacDonald's car was heavily damaged, neither she or anyone else was injured in the one-vehicle crash. MacDonald was released on a citation and is scheduled back in court on April 28 for an arraignment. Public records do not indicate MacDonald has been arrested for DWI in the past. Sentencing for a first offense in Vermont range from a license suspension of 90 days to up to two years in prison and a maximum fine of $750.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Carefree: Linda MacDonald, 55, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol Monday night in Dummerston, Vermont.

"A rare black flamingo amazed bird watchers when it was spotted feeding among a group of the traditionally pink birds in Cyprus. The migratory bird was spotted at a salt lake near the British RAF base at Akrotiri on the island's south coast close to the resort city of Limassol. Normally, the graceful birds have a pink hue caused by the levels of beto-Carotene in their diet. Scroll down for video. Ruffling feathers: The unusual black flamingo was spotted near the coastal city of Limassol on Cyprus by birdwatchers. Alexia Perdiou, the base's assistant environment officer, said it could be one-of-a-kind. 'Of course we are all very excited because we believe it could be the only flamingo of its kind in the world and very little is known about it,' she said. 'We are expecting a lot of visitors over the next few days.' A black flamingo was reportedly last spotted in Israel in 2014 and aside from its colour, it is no different to the hundreds of pink flamingos which flock to the salt lakes of Cyprus every spring. Experts believe a rare genetic irregularity known as ""melanism"" can generate more melanin than usual, turning a flamingo's feathers a dark colour. Migrating: The bird looked very healthy despite its unusual hue and is believed to be heading to Turkey to breed. Martin Hellicar of the conservation group BirdLife Cyprus said the black-coloured flamingo was not unique, though acknowledged they were uncommon in the Mediterranean. He said it was probably migrating to its breeding area in Turkey after spending the winter elsewhere. He added that the flamingo stopped on its journey in the salt lake to feed on brine shrimp.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A rare black flamingo amazed bird watchers when it was spotted feeding among a group of the traditionally pink birds in Cyprus.

"Private matter: Larry Reid was arrested about 12:30 p.m. Monday on U.S. Highway 95 near the edge of Boulder City city limits. Senator Harry Reid's 73-year-old brother has been arrested and charged with driving drunk and hitting a police officer. Larry Reid was arrested for DUI about 12:40 p.m. between Boulder City and Searchlight in Nevada. Mr. Reid was also charged with battery of a police officer, driving across a median, resisting arrest, not wearing a seat belt and possession of a gun while under the influence of alcohol. A trooper saw Larry Reid's Lexus SUV in the dirt median with the engine still running, Patrol spokesman Trooper Loy Hixson said. The Nevada Senator's office released a statement confirming that Larry Reid is the Democrat's brother, saying only that it is 'a private matter.' Details of the arrest were not immediately available since the official complaint had not been filed with the court. Meanwhile, his older brother, Senator Harry Reid, who recently suffered an accident while exercising, said in a video message last week he would not seek re-election next year, and threw his weight behind New York Senator Chuck Schumer to replace him when he leaves office. 'The job of minority leader of the United States Senate is just as important as being the majority leader,' Reid said in the video.

"A species of whale that was feared to be extinct has been found washed up on a West Australian beach, giving scientists an opportunity to learn more about the mammal. The Omura's whale was discovered on a remote Exmouth beach, at the tip of the state's North West Cape, after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn tore through the area last month. It is the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Identifying the 5.68m juvenile female was at first difficult for Department of Parks and Wildlife staff, who eventually confirmed it was an Omura's whale with DNA profiling. Scroll down for video. An Omura's whale was discovered on a remote Exmouth beach in WA (pictured). It left authorities confused as they struggled to identify the rare species. Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the find was 'highly significant' for whale scientists because very little was known about the species. 'Omura's whale was only described in scientific journals for the first time in 2003 and is apparently restricted to tropical and subtropical waters,' he said. 'The knowledge we gain from this whale will help to improve field identification guides to better understand the whale's regional distribution.' The species is usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. Omura's whales have a sleek body shape and several unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried and the skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific investigation and possibly for public display in museums.

Moody mornings: Brits wake up grumpier than anyone else in the Western world, according to users of a sleep app... despite getting more time in bed than most other nations – seven hours 22 minutes a night. But while we might sleep longer, we don’t feel as refreshed in the morning, according to results from users of the Sleep Cycle app. The app tracks how well people rest at night by using the motion sensor in their smartphone. The app then comes up with a ‘sleep score’ for the user. By looking at results from 944,000 people, including 75,000 from the UK, researchers found the British had the seventh most disturbed sleep out of 50 countries surveyed. And our mood on waking – determined by users tapping a ‘happy’, ‘sad’ or ‘in-between’ face – was fourth worst, even though we spend more time in bed than anyone bar the Finns (7hrs 23mins), Dutch (7hrs 24mins) and New Zealanders (7hrs 27mins).

"The body of Kyle Knox has been found near the foot of Ben Nevis three weeks after he disappeared. The body of a missing hiker has been found three weeks after he vanished trying to climb Britain's highest mountain. Kyle Knox, from London, was last seen alive at the foot of Ben Nevis on March 31. The 23-year-old was reported missing the following day when he failed to return to his hotel in Fort William. When he vanished people were being urged not to go to Scotland's mountains unless they had the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions. The mercury had plunged to minus seven and winds of up to 70mph were recorded in the region. There was also snow on the mountain's peak. It was believed Kyle, who was not an experienced walker, had attempted to climb the Ben Nevis alone. When he set off on the climb Kyle was wearing dark waterproof trousers, walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it. Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were launched after the alarm was raised, with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene. Search and rescue dogs also joined in the hunt for missing Kyle. Rescuers were forced to call off the hunt due to band weather in the Scottish Highlands. Today, a body was recovered by a Royal Navy Helicopter in the Surgeon's Gully area, to the south east of Ben Nevis. It has been identified as that of Mr Knox and his family have been informed. It was believed that Mr Knox, 23, of London, was attempting to scale the 4409-ft high peak alone.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'The body of Kyle Knox has been found near the foot of Ben Nevis three weeks after he disappeared.

"An 18-year-old student who stripped naked and ran through the streets of Byron Bay to win a free kebab has been labelled a 'goose' in court. Jack Mascitelli, from Victoria, took up the unsavoury dare in broad daylight at 8.45am during schoolies week in the popular NSW beach town. The prank backfired when he accidentally ran 'screaming and yelling' past a group of police officers, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The officers then found him hiding in a nearby kebab shop. Jack Mascitelli, from Victoria, ran through Byron Bay naked during schoolies week for a free kebab. Mr Mascitelli, who is studying law and commerce at university, was fined $500 for offensive behaviour. Appearing in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on Monday to argue against the fine, Deputy Chief Magistrate Chris O'Brien told Mr Mascitelli: 'What a goose. That's what you are.' 'This is 8.45 in the morning and you are running through the streets with no clothes on. I don't know why you would want a kebab at that time of day,' he added. Mr O'Brien pointed out how children could have seen Mr Mascitelli expose himself and called his actions 'embarrassing'. 'If people had been there with their children, or in my case my grandchildren, to see you exposing yourself ... they're wandering off to have a swim and there you are in all your glory,' Mr O'Brien said. Despite the dressing down inside the courtroom, Mr O'Brien did not record a conviction and said Mr Mascitelli was apologetic. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Mascitelli for comment.

"The British Army fired 46 million bullets at the Taliban during the eight-year Afghanistan conflict at a cost of £200 million in ammunition alone. The large amount of ammunition expended during the conflict shows the intense nature of the fighting between British troops and their Taliban opponents.

"Two children have been killed in what police are calling an accidental vehicle fire at a Las Vegas apartment complex. Investigators say four children were playing in and around a parked minivan Saturday evening at the Arcadia Palms on East Sahara Avenue  when one of them unintentionally set a fire inside. Two of the children managed to escape unharmed and quickly requested help. The other two children became trapped and were found dead inside after the fire was put out. Two young children have died after a minivan they were playing in on the parking lot of the Arcadia Palms apartment complex in Las Vegas caught fire and exploded (police scene pictured) Police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental, and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child who started the fire. The names and ages of the children as well as the cause of the fire were not immediately released. Kelvin Young, 29, a resident of the complex, told the Las Vegas Review Journal he went toward the burning vehicle after he saw a plume of smoke. Shortly after, he described hearing a woman shout 'My baby!' and 'My nephew!' Another resident told KLAS-TV that a woman, believed to be one of the boy's mother, was taken to hospital shortly after the incident and described hearing a huge explosion.

"An investigation has been launched at a £33,000-a-year school after students were taught the wrong exam text. Students at Wellington College, in Berkshire, spent the last year studying a different classic book for their imminent AS-level exam. The mistake only came to light when mock papers arrived and no exam questions related to the taught text. Prestigious: A spokeswoman for the school, which charges £33,000-a-year, said parents had been satisfied by the prompt actions of the school after staff discovered they had been teaching the wrong English text. Now pupils will have to cram their studying into just a few weeks with extra lessons put in place by the school. Sources close to the school, which proudly boasts to be the Best Public School in the Tatler Schools Guide 2014 on its website, said students were left devastated by the blunder. The mistake is believed to have occurred when a teacher changed a text on a spreadsheet without notifying other staff. According to The Sun, the college, whose alumni includes Will Young, Rory Bremner and Made in Chelsea's Caggie Dunlop, apologised for the error but would not name the works of literature involved. Stumped: Students at the posh school are said to be upset by the blunder which has seen nearly a year of hard work go to waste (file photo) A spokeswoman said: 'Only one AS-level English text was wrong out of several. This happened two months before the exam is due to take place. 'A programme of extra lessons was immediately put in place. Students and parents expressed satisfaction with the prompt way the school addressed this. 'The school is running an investigation to see what has happened. No teacher has been sacked.

Prestigious: A spokeswoman for the school, which charges £33,000-a-year, said parents had been satisfied by the prompt actions of the school after staff discovered they had been teaching the wrong English text. Now pupils will have to cram their studying into just a few weeks with extra lessons put in place by the school. Sources close to the school, which proudly boasts to be the Best Public School in the Tatler Schools Guide 2014 on its website, said students were left devastated by the blunder. The mistake is believed to have occurred when a teacher changed a text on a spreadsheet without notifying other staff. According to The Sun, the college, whose alumni includes Will Young, Rory Bremner and Made in Chelsea's Caggie Dunlop, apologised for the error but would not name the works of literature involved. Stumped: Students at the posh school are said to be upset by the blunder which has seen nearly a year of hard work go to waste (file photo) A spokeswoman said: 'Only one AS-level English text was wrong out of several. This happened two months before the exam is due to take place. 'A programme of extra lessons was immediately put in place. Students and parents expressed satisfaction with the prompt way the school addressed this. 'The school is running an investigation to see what has happened. No teacher has been sacked. Wellington College is sorry this mistake happened.'' Provide only the summary as the response.",3ad4882ad0d84a44a9d5a1cb6bb926d2
"Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. Scroll down for video. CLAIM: MP Jesse Norman is being investigated by police over claims he attempted to 'bribe' voters with chocolate cake, pictured above. Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. The 57-year-old has criticised the 'absolutely ridiculous'  investigation after he was told he will face no further action. Mr Rose said: 'The officers told me today that I have now entered the political world and I must no longer hand out sausage rolls. 'They told me I have got to watch anything I do. So I'm going to stay away from bakeries from now on - if I see one I'm going to run a mile.'

"The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has been caught on camera knocking back drinks with a high-class call girl. But sadly for scandalmongers, the chance encounter between Danny Alexander and Brooke Magnanti – better known by her former alias Belle de Jour – was innocent. The two were snapped at Bar One in Inverness on Friday as part of the Nip festival, which celebrates the gins and whiskies of the Highlands. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander pictured drinking with call girl Brooke Magnanti. Mr Alexander was snapped with Ms Magnati - also known as Belle de Jour - at the Nip festival. It comes as David Cameron faced a growing revolt last night over his 'flat-footed' General Election campaign. Several MPs pointed the finger of blame at the Prime Minister's Australian Election guru Lynton Crosby. And a former Conservative Cabinet Minister criticised George Osborne's 'Dickensian' message on 'Austerity Britain'. The first signs of a Tory wobble emerged after last week's polls suggested that instead of leaving Labour trailing, as Tory chiefs had expected, Labour is slightly ahead. And far from collapsing under the weight of massed Tory attacks, Labour leader Ed Miliband's ratings have improved. In an outspoken intervention, retiring Conservative MP Brian Binley said: 'With the Election campaign well under way, Mr Cameron still appears to be standing apart and aloof, almost like a spectator.' He added: 'Flat-footed and lame, we already look as if we're running to catch up.'","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has been caught on camera knocking back drinks with a high-class call girl.

"A hero pilot pulled his plane out of a terrifying North Sea nosedive with just seven seconds to spare. The plane began to plunge after it was struck by lightning, but autopilot ignored the pilot’s commands to climb and tried to crash the plane into the sea. The airliner pitched down, falling at 9,500ft a minute, and fell to just 1,100ft above the ocean before its commander wrestled back control just moments before it was about to crash into the icy water. The Loganair flight was just seconds from crashing into the north sea before its commander saved the day. The 42-year-old pilot put out a Mayday emergency signal before regaining control and saving his 30 passengers and three crew just moments before the plane plunged into the sea. The island-hopping Loganair flight from Aberdeen to Shetland was put off its approach by thunderstorms, snow, hail and 70mph winds on the evening of December 15. A ball of lightning then appeared outside the cockpit and a lightning bolt struck the Saab 2000 plane’s nose, and then travelled the full length of the aircraft before leaving its tail. The aircraft landed safely in Aberdeen with only minor damage and no injuries. An AAIB probe discovered that the autopilot on the Loganair Saab 2000 G-LGNO had remained engaged and the pilot’s actions were countered by the system, causing the dive. No technical problems were found with the aircraft, which is now back in service, and pilot training is now included simulations of the incident according to the AAIB report.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A hero pilot pulled his plane out of a terrifying North Sea nosedive with just seven seconds to spare.

"An unnamed hit band from the 1960s attended the same paedophile brothel as shamed BBC star Jimmy Savile. The group were identified in a secret police intelligence report from 1964 in a four-page document. The document related to a notorious flat in Battersea, South West London which was used by paedophiles. Scroll down for video. Top of the Pops star Jimmy Savile, pictured, was known to frequent a paedophile brothel in Battersea. It is not clear whether the band and Savile attended the brothel at the same time, but they have all been linked to the property. Savile was known to be a regular visitor in the 1970s. The senior officer responsible for Operation Yewtree , Detective Superintendent David Grey began investigating the brothel in 2013 when it was mentioned in another police report. Det Supt Grey said a woman came forward in 2003 and reported that Savile had abused her during the 1970s following an appearance on Top of the Pops. The DJ died in 2011 when his terrible secret life became public knowledge. Details of the alleged assault were never put on the police computer. Det Supt Grey told the Daily Mirror: 'Although Savile and a pop group were known to frequent, that does not in itself show linkage  or grounds to investigate further except with the benefit of hindsight.'

"A woman who was arrested and charged with manslaughter for a crash that caused the death of a 5-year-old child showed no remorse for her actions according to court records. Aaronessa Keaton of Phoenix, Arizona was eight months pregnant and had marijuana and Benzodiazepines in her system when she collided head-on with a car carrying two children in February 2014, and one of the children later died from their injuries. When told of this after her arrest, Keaton, 24, said; 'Sh*t happens.' Aaronessa Keaton (above) was arrested Monday and charged with manslaughter for a 2014 accident that resulted in the death of a 5-year-old child. Keaton hit another car head-on (above) while she was eight months pregnant and had marijuana and Benzodiazepines in her system. Keaton, who was also on probation for marijuana possession charges at the time, was indicted by a grand jury in February, and taken in Monday after she was pulled over for a traffic stop. According to CBS 5, Keaton was driving southbound on February 28, 2014 when she swiped a car going north, and she then continued across the northbound lane until she struck a 2007 Nissan Frontier. That car contained the child whose injuries were so severe they later died. The other child in the car was in serious condition, but later made a full recovery, and both adults in the front seat suffered only minor injuries. Keaton was also rushed to the hospital where an emergency C-section was performed.

"Nigel Farage, pictured after Reckless's defection to Ukip, is likely to look a little less smug after it was revealed the Rochester and Strood MP is facing an uphill struggle to keep his seat. The Tory MP who defected to Ukip to trigger the Rochester and Strood by-election is on course to lose the seat at the General Election. According to the latest secret polling bombshell to hit Nigel Farage’s party, Mark Reckless, who became Ukip’s second MP last November, faces an uphill battle to hold on to his 2,920 majority on May 7. The disclosure comes after Ukip was thrown into turmoil by last week’s leak to The Mail on Sunday of a survey showing Mr Farage trailing the Tories in his target seat of Thanet South. The private Rochester data is understood to put Mr Reckless narrowly behind the Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst, who he defeated in November’s by-election. When Mr Reckless stood for the Tories at the 2010 Election he had a majority of just under 10,000 votes. As with the Thanet South poll, the party has decided against publicising the figures in case supporters are demoralised. A senior Ukip source said: ‘It is not looking easy for Mark, but we are hopeful the figures are misleading.’ However, another source added: ‘We aren’t that bothered because Reckless isn’t particularly popular.’ Some analysts think Ukip could be left with just one MP – Douglas Carswell, who won Clacton in a byelection with a 12,000 majority. Last night Ukip denied the party had itself commissioned polling in Rochester but said: ‘We always knew it would be a tough fight.’ Ukip convert Mark Reckless faces an uphill battle to hold on to his 2,920 majority in Rochester and Strood.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Nigel Farage, pictured after Reckless's defection to Ukip, is likely to look a little less smug after it was revealed the Rochester and Strood MP is facing an uphill struggle to keep his seat.

"The naked bodies of a young couple were found stuffed in boxes in India after becoming victims of a suspected honour killing. Locals discovered the dead pair, believed to be in their mid to late 20s, in separate metal trunks in a public park in Haryana state, around 30 miles south of New Delhi. Police said the man's legs had been chopped off and put inside the trunk, while his partner was found wearing a set of glass bangles traditionally worn by newlywed women. Macabre: The naked bodies of a young couple are found stuffed in boxes in a northern Indian state, the suspected victims of an honour killing. 'It appears they were strangulated and dumped here later. They are yet to be identified,' the chief investigating officer, Praveen Kumar, told AFP. 'It seems like a case of honour killing because the woman is wearing wedding bangles but we are not ruling out other motives,' he added. India has witnessed honour killings - where couples are targeted because their families or communities disapprove of their relationships - for centuries, especially in rural areas. They are carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family's reputation and pride in a hereditary-based caste system. The latest incident comes two days after Haryana police arrested a man and his son for killing his teenage daughter over an inter-caste relationship with a boy. In 2013, a man was beheaded and his wife was killed by her own family for eloping within the same clan.

Kemery, told police that he rented the car in Florida and drove north to the Hamptons and discovered the car had bedbugs. He said that a friend had explained to him the best way to kill bedbugs was to douse them in alcohol. Inspired, Kemery did just that. However, he then made the near fatal mistake of getting into the car and lighting his cigarette, thereby igniting the alchol and setting himself on fire.

"A father and two children, aged eight and two, were killed after their SUV rolled over on a highway. The car, which was carrying 12, crashed when a blown tire caused the 2006 Ford Expedition to overturn Saturday in Martin County, on central Florida's Atlantic Coast. Authorities say 38-year-old Uriel Miranda died at the scene and his 2-year-old daughter Yaretsi Miranda died Saturday evening at a hospital. Scroll down for video. Father, Uriel Miranda, 38 (left)  and two children, Yordi Miranda, 8, (right) and Yaretsi Miranda, 2,  were killed after their SUV rolled over highway. Eight-year-old Yordi Miranda died Sunday at a hospital. Troopers say all 12 occupants were relatives from Apopka and a police report indicated half of them weren't wearing seat belts. Authorities said Uriel and the toddler were not wearing seatbelts. Authorities say the driver and a 7-year-old boy were treated at a hospital and released. The car, which was carrying 12 passengers, crashed when a left rear tire tread separated on the Florida Turnpike. Authorities said Uriel and the toddler were not wearing seatbelts. Seven other relatives ranging from ages 3 to 34 remained hospitalized. Sgt. Mark Wysocky with the Florida Highway Patrol  said the SUV had a capacity of nine occupants. Neighbors of the family told Channel 9 Yordi was battling cancer, reports WFTV. Neighbors said  the children's mother is a few weeks pregnant. 'It's really sad because they didn't deserve it, they were good people,'  Jessica Garcia, told WPTV. 'They were traveling supposedly, from what I know, to the beach to Miami, and then come back on Monday.' The crash is under investigation.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A father and two children, aged eight and two, were killed after their SUV rolled over on a highway.

"At Tokyo's Narita Airport, the newly-opened Terminal 3 sure has some quirky features. Among them, strips of brightly-coloured running track, which have been installed in the airport's hallways. While of course passengers are entertained by the latest buzzworthy stunt, we have to wonder: were they really intended to encourage travellers to dash to their boarding gate? Tokyo's Narita Airport has installed running tracks in its new Terminal 3 in honour of the 2020 Olympics. Turns out that the cushioned tracks were actually designed to celebrate the 2020 Olympics, which will be held in Tokyo. But there's no denying that the footpaths are extremely useful regardless. The blue path leads passengers toward departures, while arrivals can be reached by following the red pathway. Further, in each lane there are a series of icons, which include information such as the distance to other terminals, directions to nearby restaurants and shops and where to find outside transport options. The recently-opened terminal will be primarily used for departures and arrivals of low-cost carriers. To save money, the airport installed these cushioned running tracks, which also include directional information. All of the blue lanes lead towards the departure area, while the red track leads travellers to arrivals. The new terminal, which will be used for many of the city's low-cost carrier departures, first opened on April 8 and according to the website, the aim of the innovative tracks was, in part, to save money. 'To cut costs, we opted not to install the typical moving walkways or illuminated signs,' the terminal's website reads. 'Instead, to offer an exciting walking experience that is easy on the feet, we implemented running tracks used for track and field, and added signage for user-friendly guidance.'","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'At Tokyo's Narita Airport, the newly-opened Terminal 3 sure has some quirky features.

"A newly-wed couple were taken on a romantic flight over the Mediterranean which left airline enthusiasts baffled after the passenger jet flew in the shape of two giant hearts shortly after takeoff. The Air Malta jet was tracked by flightradar24.com as it took off the island's international airport as it embarked on the unusual flight. The Airbus A319 flew two circuits around Malta, with final section skirting the Italian coast. The Air Malta passenger jet took the unusual flight path, pictured, to celebrate the wedding of two of its crew. The special flight was to celebrate the marriage one of the airline's pilot to a member of cabin crew. The jet took the happy couple's family and friends on a short sight-seeing tour over the Mediterranean. The arrivals' board at Malta International Airport provided some clues as to the reason behind the unusual flight path with the status 'Just Married' placed beside flight KM 14JC. A spokeswoman for Air Malta told Sky News that the couple were married at the airport earlier that day. She revealed: 'They are both members of staff at Air Malta. 'He is a pilot and she is a member of cabin crew. They were joined on the flight by family, friends and colleagues who had been at the wedding. 'I think it was a very romantic flight. They flew close to Sicily, so they could see Mount Etna through the window.'

"Puren - who has died aged 96 - was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi (above), who ruled for four years until 1912. The brother of China's last emperor who was pushed off the throne more than 100 years ago has died. Puren was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi, who ruled for four years until 1912. The 96-year-old died on Friday after being taken to hospital with pneumonia in February, his family said. He had been suffering from poor health and memory loss in recent years. One of his sons told The Legal Evening News that Puren - who took the Chinese name Jin Youzhi - was 'almost deaf'. 'He even couldn't hold a pen... he couldn't recognise people,' the son added. Puyi became emperor in 1908 when he was two years and ten months old. His abdication ended the rule of the Qing dynasty, which began in 1644. After the government took power in 1912 Puyi and his close family were forced to live within the walls of the Forbidden City, where they retained imperial traditions and were tended to by eunuchs. They were expelled from the palace complex in 1917. Puren established a primary school with the help of his father in the 1940s and continued to teach until he retired in the late 1960s. He reportedly had three sons and two daughters. The Communist party which took power in 1949 also reportedly gave him a place on the local Beijing branch of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a mostly symbolic body. A memorial for Puren will be held at the Babaoshan Cemetery in Beijing. The former emperor is pictured (right) with their father and younger brother in front of a beautiful picture.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Puren - who has died aged 96 - was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi (above), who ruled for four years until 1912.

"Dozens of public servants were less than humoured when they were told their jobs would be lost in a cruel April Fools' Day prank. The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were given an 'announcement' on a big TV screen that their workplace was being closed and moved to Melbourne. DFAT has since reprimanded the staff member responsible for the stunt, which saw 30 low-ranking employees told they needed to apply for expressions of interest if they wanted to keep their jobs by moving to Melbourne. The Canberra based Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade workers were met with this 'announcement' on a big TV screen. The message was displayed for five hours before one of the centre's supervisors told workers that it was an April Fools' Day prank. The workers had good cause to fear for their jobs: DFAT is planning to cut 500 jobs by June. The main role of the employees involved in the parnk is to ensure passport applicants meet the requirements in a process known as 'ELLO'. The announcement said the office was undergoing 'substantial' changes and would be moving all 'ELLO' roles to Melbourne as a result. It comes as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Tradeplans plans to cut 500 jobs by June this year. The Community and Public Sector Union's national secretary Nadine Flood said it was tasteless to joke about something perceived as a genuine fear, according to The Guardian.

"A New York dental clinic manager has been arrested on charges she posed as an actual dentist and even pulled patients' teeth. Valbona Yzeiraj was arrested on Thursday and pleaded not guilty to charges of assault, unauthorized practice of a profession and reckless endangerment. Authorities said the 45-year-old woman, from White Plains, did injections in people's mouths, performed root canals and on several occasions pulled patients' teeth. Valbona Yzeiraj was arrested on Thursday (pictured right) and pleaded not guilty to charges of assault after she illegally posed as dentist 'Dr Val' and pulled patients' teeth out at a practice in Riverdale, New York. According to CBS, she called herself 'Dr Val', putting on a lab coat when her boss, Dr Jeffrey Schoengold, wasn't present and doing dental work on unsuspecting patients. Dr Schoengold became suspicious when at least four people complained over work he had not done. One patient suffered an infection from a botched root canal and another patient was left with pain two years on from a procedure, CBS reported. Prosecutors said she was fired from Ultimate Dental Care of Riverdale after the company found out she was performing as a dentist from late 2012 to summer 2013. It is then alleged that she tried to steal from the practice. The company hasn't returned a message left seeking comment. Yzeiraj's attorney didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. Bail has been set at $20,000 bond and the 45-year-old was due back in court on May 28. She claimed to have dental training in her native Albania but authorities said she had no license in the U.S. Yzeiraj was fired from Ultimate Dental Care of Riverdale, New York (pictured) after the company found out she was illegally performing as a dentist from late 2012 to summer 2013.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A New York dental clinic manager has been arrested on charges she posed as an actual dentist and even pulled patients' teeth.

The casually-dressed 52-year-old is said to be able to speak fluent English - but seemingly failed to pick up the meaning of the T-shirt. Ecuador's leader Rafael Correa (right) posed for a picture next to a boy wearing an 'I'm With Stupid' T-shirt. The picture was shared thousands of times on social media networks in the country.

"Larry Upright hated Hillary so much she made it into his obituary. A North Carolina man's obituary asked two things of friends and family: instead of sending flowers for the funeral, give the money to charity. And don't vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. The family of 81-year-old Larry Upright added the political message to the obituary announcing the Kannapolis man's death and burial this week. Upright's daughter, Jill McLain, said the rock-ribbed Republican was passionate about politics. She says that recollection prompted his family to ask obituary readers to reject Clinton's presidential bid, not necessarily to spark controversy. 'We did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad,' Jill McLain told WSOC-TV. Mike Upright said his deceased father voiced his opinions regularly. 'We did this for him,' Mike Upright said. 'We know he's up there giggling right now. Just laughing out loud.' The obituary also describes Upright as an active member of local Masonic and Shriners organizations and a country club. He retired after a career in the building automation industry. For their dad: 'We did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad,' said his daughter Jill McLain. Meanwhile, a group of Nevada sex workers have come out in favor of the Democratic contender.

"NHS finances are so dire that patients could soon be forced to pay to use basic services such as GPs, doctors leaders warned last night. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges. All three major parties have denied there will be any end to the principle that the NHS should be free at the point of use. Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges. Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade, there would be much more money around. In an interview with the Guardian, Dr Porter said of the parties fighting the election: ‘I think they will be tempted. They said in 1950 that a Labour government wouldn’t introduce charging and it did.’ The introduction of prescription charges prompted NHS founder Nye Bevan to resign from Clement Attlee’s government in April 1951.

"A passenger became so angry during an argument about overweight luggage that she slapped an airline employee. The Vietnamese woman was waiting to board at Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, when the incident took place.

Nguyen Thi Hang placed her luggage on the scales, and then lashed out hitting an airport worker in the face. The woman, who has been named locally as Nguyen Thi Hang, 35, was stopped by a VietJet Air employee who believed her two pieces of hand luggage weighed more than the 7kg permitted. The woman proceeded to place her luggage on the weighing scales, but in a fit of anger lashed out and slapped the member of staff in the face. The scales showed the luggage did indeed weigh more than the allowance permitted. The Vietnamese woman was set to bound  VietjetAir flight to the capital city of Hanoi. Thi Hang was flying into the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. Aviation authorities told tuoitrenews.vn that 'passengers are allowed to carry only one piece of portable baggage weighing up to 7kg with a of size 56x36x23 cm when boarding an aircraft' and that 'any excess baggage must be deposited at check-in counters before boarding.'

Mrs Harris wept in court and covered her face as the verdict came back, Sacramento Bee reported. Robert Harris, 72, was found dead from a shotgun blast at the couple's home in 2013. Colleen Harris testified that she couldn't recall the events leading up to his death because of traumatic memory loss. She could get 50 years to life when she is sentenced on June 5. Colleen Harris was charged in the 1985 shotgun killing of her then-husband, 46-year-old James Batten.

Ed Miliband is paying an Argentinian company which has attacked ‘vulture’ American bankers to help him become Prime Minister. Tory MPs last night claimed Labour’s Argentinian link was an ‘embarrassment’ for Miliband. Tectonica – dubbed ‘Argie & Argie’ in a jokey reference to Saatchi & Saatchi, the agency that famously helped Margaret Thatcher win the 1979 Election – is best known for its aggressive campaign against the US in a row over Argentina’s debt crisis, which dates back to the 1982 Falklands War. Its website echoes Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner’s attack on ‘senile’ US judge Thomas Griesa, who ruled last year that Argentina must drop its refusal to pay back nearly £1 billion to US investors.

'I was just thinking too that the commuter rail is finally on time again, and now the poor people got on the train and now they're going to be delayed again,' she told WHDH News. On the highway there were also massive delays.

At least six former Ukrainian government officials from Yanukovych's time have died over the past two months in various circumstances that police have said were most likely suicides. Yanukovych fled in February 2014 after months of increasingly violent protests. He later resurfaced in Russia. Senior ministry official Anton Gerashchenko said. Kalashnikov, 52, had knowledge of the 'Anti-Maidan' movement,. which opposed pro-Western protests that ousted Yanukovich, suggesting this might be a motive for his alleged murder. The ministry had opened up a criminal case, he said. There were mass protests against Yanukovych last year in Kiev's Maidan Square. 'Without doubt the deceased knew a lot about who financed. Anti-Maidan and in what way... He takes these secrets with him. to the grave,' Gerashchenko said. On Thursday, meanwhile, a prominent Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views was shot dead  in Kiev by two masked gunmen.

"A man dubbed 'New Zealand's worst ever drink driver' has been released from prison, despite describing himself as 'a danger to the community'. Raymond Charles Laing has spent the past three years behind bars after he was busted more than three times over the legal limit behind the wheel. He has been convicted 26 times for drink-driving, and a further 31 times for driving while disqualified. The man dubbed 'New Zealand's worst ever drink driver' has been released from prison, despite describing himself as 'a danger to the community' Laing was earlier jailed for two-and-a-half years for drink-driving, assault and dangerous driving causing injury in 2010, according to the Sunday Star Times. Before he was due to appear before the parole board last month, Laing sent a letter to the board that said 'I am a high risk offender and danger to the community'. Despite his comments, Laing will walk free on May 15. Raymond Laing has been convicted for drink-driving on 26 different occasions, along with 31 convictions for driving while disqualified. Before he was due to appear before the parole board last month, Laing sent a letter to the board that said 'I am a high risk offender and danger to the community' (stock picture) After his release, Laing will be forced to live at an approved address, complete an alcohol and drug treatment program and attend any psychological assessment and counselling ordered by his parole officer. He is also banned from drinking alcohol. Drink Driving Interventions Trust co-director Roger Brooking said punishment for the offence in New Zealand was lenient, and more needed to be done to keep potential risks off the roads.

"A French bus driver has proposed putting on a separate service for Roma passengers - because the 'unbearable' smell is a health risk to everyone on board. Dominique Granier sparked outrage after he suggested putting on a service specifically for people travelling from a Roma encampment next to a cemetery into the centre of Montpellier, in the south of France. But while his comments were immediately met with horror by some, the bus company TAM has taken his comments seriously and is said to have 'outsourced' part of the route. Odour: The smell on route 9 in Montpellier is said to be 'unbearable' and caused by Roma using the service. Bus driver Mr Granier said the smell which accompanied the Roma was a 'sanitation risk' in an interview last week. Speaking to the Gazette de Montpelier Mr Granier said: 'It is a true infection.' His claims were backed up by other drivers, one of whom claimed the buses were now specially cleaned because of the odour. Bernard Gotis, a local union representative, was disgusted by the comments. 'We should not tackle the poor, but poverty... We do not want to recreate apartheid in Montpellier,' he said. Apartheid: Some have said the problem is poverty of those living in the camp. Pictured: Roma in Montpellier. However, Mr Gotis revealed the bus company had taken on the suggestion, and apparently outsourced part of the route so drivers no longer had to contend with the smell. He told French newspaper Libération: 'Our management decided to follow the union by removing a piece of this bus line which is very popular with Roma and to outsource this portion of line.' The MailOnline has contacted Montpellier's bus service for a comment.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A French bus driver has proposed putting on a separate service for Roma passengers - because the 'unbearable' smell is a health risk to everyone on board.

"Forget sit and lie down. This skillful pooch has mastered the art of paw-stand walking. Loren Mathieson filmed her pet Boston Terrier, Gizmo, performing the gravity-defying stunt one day at home after he tried on a set of new booties. Footage shows him taking a few steps forwards before planting down his front feet and launching his back legs vertically in the air. He then proceeds to walk forwards, performing some graceful sidesteps as he goes. Mathieson can be heard laughing while she watches Gizmo in action. When he reaches her on the floor, he eventually steps back down to four paws. Mathieson said Gizmo performed the trick because he was unsure how to walk in his new black boots.

"This is the comical moment a delirious wisdom tooth patient refuses milkshake in fear that it could - in singer Kelis' words - 'bring all the boys to her yard'. Faith Myers, 14, from Nebraska, was filmed by her mother as she woke in bed still 'high' from the procedure's anesthesia. Footage shows her being quizzed about what she would like to eat, with the thought of a shake clearly filling her with dread. 'I don't want all the boys in my yard,' she immediately chimes through a mouthful of blood-stained tissues. 'You don't want any boys in your yard? Will your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?' her amused mother responds. 'Yeah, I don't want them here,' Faith confirms with a look of fear on her face. The teen's mood then takes a more sinister turn as she declares that she will 'bring out a shotgun' if any boys come into her yard. 'Bang, bang!' she exclaims, with a look of glee in her eyes.

"They may not be much of a match in terms of size - but that proved no obstacle for the budding friendship between this tiny kitten and the Dalmatian who towers over him. Uno, just three weeks old, and Louie, a full-grown dog, were together at home in Spokane, Washington, earlier this month. The clip begins with one of the Pogue family, who recently adopted Uno, tentatively holding him before the two pets are introduced. Adorable: Louie, a full-grown Dalmatian, is shown here snuggling with Uno, a three-week old kitten. After carefully saying hello to Louie's left forepaw, Uno climbs over and settle down between the huge canine's front legs. Louie then shifts his position, giving Uno the chance to nuzzle and lick his neck, before settling down underneath one of his floppy ears. After Uno noses his way forward so the two creatures' faces are side by side, Louie turns his head and nuzzle his new companion lovingly. Throughout the exchange Louie's mother, whom the family adopted at the same time as the kitten, looks on approvingly. According to the Pogue family, their dog has a great track record with kittens. When they have adopted young animals previously, a hug with the Dalmatian has been a rite of passage as they join the family. Getting to know you: Inquisitive Uno pokes his way around his much larger friend's body, and eventually settles under his floppy ear.

"Most people expect stunning views  from the Empire State Building or the sound of waves meeting golden sands when their partner pops the question. One lucky woman will forever associate one of the happiest days of her life with burgers and fries. This video captures the moment her boyfriend got down on one knee and popped the question inside the McDonald's restaurant where she works. The man drops down on one knee as he proposes to his girlfriend inside a McDonald's restaurant. Egged on by his friends, the man, known only as Chase, strides purposefully over to his girlfriend, who is wearing her uniform, and drops down on one knee. Many women would probably beg their beau to move a more scenic location before getting the ring out, but the woman is clearly delighted, quickly saying 'Yes'. He then places a diamond ring on her finger. The couple then engage in a passionate embrace by the food counter. The young couple embraces after she said 'yes' (left); the woman shows off her diamond ring (right) Meanwhile their friends filming the video, shot in an undisclosed city in the US, whoop and yell: 'Man this is real, this really is real'.

"Upmarket Bentleys and Porsches are more likely to break down than much cheaper cars, according to a survey. The two marques finished bottom of a 38-strong table of vehicle manufacturers judged on reliability. Scroll down for video. Reliability: Bentleys and Porsches are more likely to break down than cheaper cars according to a survey. The list price of Bentleys ranges from £136,250 to £224,700, yet the manufacturer and Porsche finished bottom of a 38-strong table judged on reliability. Thousands of cars aged three to eight years old were assessed on their failure rate, age, mileage and cost of repairs. The most reliable was Honda, with Suzuki second and Toyota in third place while Chevrolet and Mazda were joint fourth. Overall, the most reliable models were the Honda Jazz and Mitsubishi Lancer while the least reliable was the Audi RS6, which was also the most costly to fix, with an average repair bill of £1,003. Electrical faults were the most common across all cars, accounting for almost a quarter of visits to garages. Axle and suspension faults were also common, affecting 22% of cars. What Car? magazine compiled the table with the Warranty Direct website. What Car? editor Jim Holder said: 'Honda's success in the reliability index is chiefly down to low failure rates. But, when things do go wrong, the cars are also relatively cheap to fix. 'Reliability is always one of the key attributes buyers look for when considering a used car purchase, so manufacturers that consistently demonstrate durability will always do well with the consumer.'

"Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found. The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight, the may also be fattening our children. Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics, they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic. A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese, leading to fears that today's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents. Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found.

"Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy, it was revealed yesterday. Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered.

Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered.

"An Oregon couple announced they are expecting a child in a rap video they made set to the theme  from '90s television sitcom 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.' The clip, which features Jesse and Melissa Meek rapping as they drive in a car, has been viewed over 1.7 million times on YouTube. 'In Happy Valley, Oregon, livin' it wed, bought our first house and started to build our homestead,' Melissa says in the clip. Parents: Jesse and Melissa Meek announced they are expecting a child in a video set to the theme song from '90s television sitcom 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' The original song for the popular NBC sitcom, sung by star Will Smith, details how his character grew up in West Philadelphia, where he got into a neighborhood fight - and at his mother's insistence, moved to his aunt and uncle's home in their wealthy Los Angeles neighborhood. In the Meeks' parody video, Melissa raps, 'When our family and friends, who were up to no good, started asking questions about parenthood. 'We told one little lie, said ""It's not time yet."" Parents said ""We're ready for grandkids, get a move on it!""' Jesse raps that the couple thought it would take longer than the two months the pair spent trying to conceive. Melissa says in the video 'I woke up in the morning about 7 or 8 and I thought to myself, ""Oh man, I'm late!"" Looked at the test and it was finally there. The little plus sign. We're now three. Not a pair.' At the end of the video, the Meeks smile and share a sonogram of their unborn child. It took five takes to film the clip, the couple told KPTV. After finding out the gender of the child, another video is a possibility for the Meeks, the couple told the Fox affiliate. Original: Will Smith is seen here rapping the theme for 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' during the show's title sequence Big reveal: At the end of the clip, the Meeks share a sonogram of their unborn child According to KPTV, the video was made so loved ones living far away could know about the baby. Melissa told the Fox affliate of the video's success 'It was completely unexpected. Like, that was the last thing we thought would happen, that it would blow up to what it had, or what it has.' Jesse told the Oregonian 'It has been a lot of fun, but definitely way more than we ever expected.' He is the great-great-grandson of Oregon pioneer Joseph Lafayette Meek, the newspaper reported. The Oregonian reported that Melissa earlier made a video which captured Jesse's reaction when he found out about the pregnancy. Jesse learned the news after reading a tag Melissa placed on their dog, which indicated a baby was on the way.

"Rome (CNN)Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe. From Friday to Monday, a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian coast guard, which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress. On Tuesday, a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing, citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard, however, told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously, it cannot confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued. An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors, nor bodies, nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized, Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said. There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats. Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration, Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015, and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily. Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria, the IOM said. They use Libya as a country of transit. At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said. Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.

"(CNN)Eight Iranian border guards have been killed in clashes with militants near the border with Pakistan, Iranian state media reported. Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur, the state-run news agency IRNA reported. The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari, the deputy governor of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province, who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan. Iranian officials have reportedly asked Pakistani authorities to catch the surviving assailants. A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization. According to Pakistani media, Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan, the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran. The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan, according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory. One of the deadliest was in October 2013, when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan. Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks, the militants have fled back into Balochistan. ""Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists,"" IRNA said, referring to Pakistan. The Pakistani government condemned Monday's attack, calling it an ""act of terrorism."" ""The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident, which took place on Iran's territory, and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have,"" the government said in a statement Wednesday.

"(CNN)The classic video game ""Space Invaders"" was developed in Japan back in the late 1970's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan's corridors of power. Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. ""When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,"" Nakatani said. He continued: ""They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth."" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as ""among the most respected men in sports-entertainment"" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

"Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom. Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, faces several charges, including aggravated indecent assault, unlawful contact with a minor, sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said. The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March, according to prosecutors. She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep. She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors. Rebbie admitted to filming several victims, including other juveniles, but had purchased the camera specifically so he could record the now-15-year-old victim while she undressed and showered, according to the Pottstown Mercury. 'I think it's particularly horrific... and particularly for a young child when they think they're in the sanctity of their home, going through their teenage years, to be violated in the way that this young woman was violated it just goes beyond the boundaries of horrific. It's just unfathomable,'  Limerick Police Chief William Albany told the Mercury. The relationship between Rebbie and the girl's family is unknown. Rebbie's preliminary hearing is on May 1 and he is being held on a $500,000 bail.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Kevin Rebbie, 56, of Limerick Township, Pennsylvania, was arrested after a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera in her bathroom that police were able to trace back to the man A Pennsylvania man was arrested after allegedly sexually abusing a girl in her home over a four-year period and filming the girl, now 15, and others with a hidden camera in a bathroom.

"The dismissal of Paul Downton as England's managing director may be the big talking point in English cricket but focus has already shifted to the start of the county championship season. However, you don't have to go to far before talk returns to the England team again as Kevin Pietersen cut a range of emotions as he posed for the Surrey team photo before the start of the new campaign. Pietersen looked in deep thought as he sat right at the end of the team photo, but was otherwise in a jovial mood as a potentially sensational return to the England set-up took a step closer. Kevin Pietersen takes a moment to reflect ahead of a team photo shoot for Surrey The event at the KIA Oval comes before the start of the County Championship season As team-mates turn their attention to other matters, Pietersen looks ahead in deep thought The batsman joked with photographers at the KIA Oval for the photo session, with Surrey set to begin their campaign at Glamorgan on April 19.

"Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts. Kaitlyn Granado, 24, a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student, and was released on bail. Now she has been arrested again after another pupil, also aged 15, also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year. According to the affidavit, seen by the Star-Telegram, the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas. The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month. She was arrested on March 19, and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year, according to the Dallas Morning News. She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials. At the time, detectives said they didn't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils, but just days later, on March 24, officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her. A spokesman for the police department said: 'There was some discussion, some rumoring, there may have been a second person involved. 'That information came from within the school, and it turned out to be true.' Granado, who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas (pictured), was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy, also 15, and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday, and released after posting a $50,000 bail. It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her. A spokesman for Irving school district said: 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details, we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action. 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property.'","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Kaitlyn Granado, 24, was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil, 15, in her car on consecutive nights in January A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts.

The clip shows a large croc calmly moving through the marina in the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta, in Mexico, with a black dog wearing a red collar lifeless in its mouth. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages, not moving at all'.

"Steve Bruce is adamant he can keep Hull City in the Barclays Premier League after a 2-0 defeat by Southampton left them battling to stay up. At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive, but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough.' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing. Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. But Bruce insisted: 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I'm sure and convinced that we'll do it. If we keep remaining positive I'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line. 'We've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final, staying up last year. I've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you've created an expectation and unfortunately we haven't been able to live up to that expectation. Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone 'We've got our reasons for it, we've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope. We're bang in it but I'm still convinced we'll get out of it.' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players. At St Mary's Stadium, Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three. Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all.

"A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results.

"The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday. While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby's on Wednesday.

"Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf. The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal, following an outcry on his behalf.

"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: '(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday.

"One Missouri mom is making the best out of a less than ideal situation. Becky Schoenig of St. Louis, Missouri was shocked when she realized her brand new 2015 Ford Fusion had been stolen from her driveway on Monday night, just a little over a month after she took the car home. Then, on April 1, Schoenig was shocked to learn that police had found her car after receiving a tip from a man who recognized the vehicle as Schoenig's and would be returning it to her - but with a few minor changes. Scroll down for video Bling: Becky Schoenig was shocked when her stolen car was located and returned to her with new red rims and detailing (above) Theft: The brand new 2015 Ford Fusion (above) had been stolen from her driveway Monday Racer: She took to Facebook after getting the car back, writing; 'I want to thank the car thieves for pimping out my vehicle for me.... This b***h is pimpin now!!!' As the car pulled up, Schoenig noticed that the rims had been spray painted red, there was red detailing on the sides of the car, and her steering wheel now had some orange accents. Rather than get upset however, she simply took to Facebook and posted a photo of her and her new ride, writing; 'I want to thank the car thieves for pimping out my vehicle for me.... This b***h is pimpin now!!!' She also attached a photo of the car which, given the date, many thought was a joke. It was not all 'lollipops and rainbows' though Schoenig told KSDK, and she is now getting the vehicle professionally cleaned to deal with the strong smell of cigarettes and marijuana. She is also creating a smoothie at the restaurant she owns, The Hot Pot, to honor Mick Sexton, the man who located her car and notified police. The Sexton on Wheels will feature banana, pineapple, peach and coconut cream. 'She's a very special person,' said Marlene Trice, a friend of Schoenig.

"First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby'. Kits aside, this was probably as far removed from Sunday's big match as you could imagine. For a start, no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English. Of those, 10 were Mancunian. Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen. Altrincham's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford, but it does have a proud history of its own. It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United's Carrington complex, where Paul McGuinness's Under 18s usually ply their trade. The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors. And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team. In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood, from just down the road in Sale, came closest for City with an audacious chip. United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford, another local lad from whom big things are expected, wasted two decent opportunities when put through. Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first. In March, the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players. He was at it again here, showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul. After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal. Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post. The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser. Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote. The result leaves United, who have won two of this year's cross-town clashes, two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand. Injury-ravaged City however, have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series.

"(CNN)The parents of the youngest victim of the Boston Marathon bombings are making an emotional, passionate plea to take the death penalty off the table for the man convicted in the case. Last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 charges he faced related to the bombings at the 2013 race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward. A look at all of the charges The sentencing phase begins Tuesday, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. It is expected to last four weeks. The 13th Juror: Now it gets real In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe, Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son, Martin. Their daughter, Jane, also was severely injured. ""Our family has grieved, buried our young son, battled injuries, and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same,"" they said in the Globe column titled ""To end the anguish, drop the death penalty."" ""We sat in the courtroom, day after day, bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs, replicated bombs, and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive."" They said they understood the ""heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed."" ""We were there. We lived it. The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul."" But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close. ""We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal,"" they wrote. They go on to say: ""We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives. We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring."" Martin Richard and two others were killed and more 200 people wounded when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line on April 15, 2013. Tsarnaev was convicted last week, while his brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police two years ago. The Richards never mention Tsarnaev by name. They stress that they were only speaking for themselves when they argue against the death penalty. ""We believe that now is the time to turn the page, end the anguish, and look toward a better future -- for us, for Boston, and for the country,"" they wrote.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: '(CNN)The parents of the youngest victim of the Boston Marathon bombings are making an emotional, passionate plea to take the death penalty off the table for the man convicted in the case.

"These extraordinary images show how an enormous jumbo jet has been converted into a luxury home for a mystery billionaire - complete with bedrooms, multiple lounges and an onboard restaurant.

The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon, although he will be able to fit dozens of guests.

"(CNN)SpaceX on Tuesday launched a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That was the easy part. In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful. SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: ""Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival."" He later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over. SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to ""reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred."" What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. Tuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather. CNN's Catherine E.

"Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all-new chapel of love in Las Vegas. The 69-year-old collaborated with NBC's Today show to launch a contest for one Elvis-obsessed couple to win the 'ultimate wedding'. The winning duo - announced next Monday - will tie the knot at Elvis Presley's Graceland Wedding Chapel inside the Westgate Hotel on Thursday, April 23. Novel idea: Priscilla Presley will serve as a witness at the first wedding to be held at an all new chapel of love in Las Vegas Westgate, formerly the Las Vegas Hilton, is where Elvis performed more than 830 sold-out shows. Along with the singer's former wife in the audience, the winning couple will  win a free wedding reception and hotel suite for two nights. To top it off, airfares and concert tickets to the Elvis Experience theater show will also be thrown in. While Priscilla agreed to make an appearance, the woman who wed Elvis in 1967 made one thing clear before unveiling the latest wedding chapel to bear his name: No impersonators. 'This is all first-class,' she told the Associated Press recently. 'This is not a joke. The wedding chapel is not a joke.' The actress and business magnate has been involved in the look and feel of the chapel that officials say is part of the first permanent Graceland exhibit of the singer's artifacts outside his iconic Memphis, Tennessee, home.

"Roma ended their four-month winless streak at home with a victory over Napoli in Serie A on Saturday in a key match for Champions League places. Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half. 'It's important to win a match and gain some continuity,' De Sanctis said. 'The last (four) months were tough in terms of results. So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride.' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack Pjanic (second left) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe, and Daniele de Rossi after scoring Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio, who play later on Saturday. They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30. Meanwhile, Napoli's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches, and Diego Maradona's former club remained fifth. Security was tight for Napoli's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis (right) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order. But there were no reports of problems. Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post. A few minutes later, Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi, who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in. Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma, who have fallen off the pace recently Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there wasn't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli, who officiated last year's World Cup final. In the second half, De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions. The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th. Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net.

"Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch. But that doesn’t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid  a stroke. Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera, Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage. The fish begins relaxing in the man's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man’s fingers. The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation. Repeating the process, the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man’s hand to be stroked again. Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers. The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more. The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish, clearly saddened by this, following it up to the surface of the water. According to Mr Giroux, who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel, the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish. The fish swims away from the man's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet. He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable. After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn’t play with it on a daily basis. The fish begins swimming around the man's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day. The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch. But that doesn’t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid  a stroke. Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera, Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage. The fish begins relaxing in the man's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man’s fingers. The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation. Repeating the process, the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man’s hand to be stroked again. Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers. The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more. The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish, clearly saddened by this, following it up to the surface of the water.

"There would have been no mercy in the dressing room. Nothing is sacred in the team. When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said: ‘Mind that locker, Stokesey.’ It was here, of course, that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team. Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team Stokes (left) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England But Stokes (right) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs. I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who cannot capture the imagination. He has something about him, as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson’s face during the Ashes series. He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return. But I do believe he will need careful man-managing. Peter Moores, England’s coach, dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right. The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on. England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on. It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad. What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed. He can be feisty and fiery as long as it’s natural but his aggression has to be controlled. You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets. Stokes (second left) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team Stokes (left) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally. There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible. This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game. They can only get better and that’s an exciting prospect.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'There would have been no mercy in the dressing room. Nothing is sacred in the team.

"A woman who suffered seven miscarriages has spoken of her distress after a family friend stole the money set aside for her babies' grave stone. The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle show and accused long-term chum, convicted burglar Jamie, of making off with the cash. When one of Mr Kyle's famous lie detector tests revealed that Jamie, who lives with Dawn and her partner who is also called Jamie, had done the deed, she burst into tears and stormed off. Scroll down for video Devastated: Dawn, who has had seven miscarriages, was furious to discover her friend had stolen from her The drama began when Dawn, who has previously appeared on the ITV talk show, discovered that £207 set aside for a £500 grave stone had disappeared. Suspecting house-mate Jamie and his girlfriend Carol, she confronted them but was initially met with a flat denial. 'Only him and Carol knew where it was,' she said during an angry confrontation on the ITV show. 'Me and Jamie had been saving up and only Carol knew where it was.' Unable to prove it, she asked Mr Kyle to conduct a lie detector test and when the results came back, it showed that Jamie had indeed taken the cash. Caught out: Jamie, who has been to prison for burglary, was found to be lying after taking a test Outraged: Dawn, who was going to spend the money on a gravestone, was left furious by the revelation Mr Kyle also revealed that Jamie had sent a Facebook message to Dawn during the journey to London in which he declared his undying love and confessed to taking the money but blamed it on girlfriend Carol. Speaking after the show, a sobbing Dawn said:  'I've had seven miscarriages and only one of them I've had to bury.

'We had to stand there and say goodbye to Daniel James and the last thing I wanted to do for Daniel James was put a head stone on him so he knew how much his mummy and daddy loved him.

"(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: '(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said.

"Jamie Carragher believes Brendan Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool forward after a season with no trophies and a likely finish outside the top four.

"Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk. James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The £6 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, however he is facing opposition from the Premier League. The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21. FA chairman Greg Dyke (left), speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore, wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke, the Daily Telegraph reports. According to the newspaper, the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA's England Commission. 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible,' the letter reportedly says. It adds: 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup.' Former England managers (clockwise) Glenn Hoddle, Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent. The managers add: 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility. 'However, as the England Commission's evidence has demonstrated, the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.' The rise of Harry Kane (centre) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result, and Roy Hodgson's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date, winning all five of their matches. There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players, the former England bosses reason. 'With promising players such as (Ross) Barkley, (Raheem) Sterling and (Harry) Kane starting to break through, it is clear we can still produce top young talent,' they write.

"(CNN)A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded. The whale, named Varvara, swam nearly 14,000 miles (22,500 kilometers), according to a release from Oregon State University, whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study. Varvara, which is Russian for ""Barbara,"" left her primary feeding ground off Russia's Sakhalin Island to cross the  Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja, Mexico. Varvara's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website. It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the ""warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions."" Records are nice, but Bruce Mate, the lead author of the study, thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim. During her 14,000-mile journey, Varvara visited ""three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales,"" which was a surprise to Mate, who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. ""For her to go to Mexico,"" Mate said, ""It's pretty strong evidence that it's where she's from."" Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale, but her ability to ""navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive,"" he said in the release, which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays. With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence, that number might be even lower. ""Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look,"" Mate said.

"Residents on the east coast of Japan's Hokkaido Island had an unexpected change of scenery this morning after 1,000ft of seabed was forced to the surface overnight. The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places, exposing what used to be the ocean floor. Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air. Scroll down for video Surprise! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu, on Hokkaido Island, Japan 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide', local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday. The mass, which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level,  measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long, and 100ft wide, a town official said. The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals, as there was no indication of the land movement overnight 'The local residents said they didn't hear any sounds and there were no tremors (when the land appeared),' said Katsuhiro Tanaka, the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association, who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered.

'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes,' he told AFP. It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives.

"It's crunch time this weekend at the top of the Premier League as second-placed Arsenal host table toppers Chelsea - and it appears one star of the former's team cannot wait for the ever-nearing kick-off. Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil can now countdown the minutes until the 4pm encounter on Sunday with his brand new Apple Watch. The 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in price from £299 to £13,500 - as he visited an Apple store on Thursday afternoon. Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil (right) took to Instagram to show off his new Apple Watch on Thursday Ozil compared his watch to TV character Michael Knight in the hit action show Knight Rider Ozil took to Instagram to share his joy at his latest gift, comparing his gadget to former TV character Michael Knight from the hit action show Knight Rider. Accompanied with the caption: 'Excited about my new cool gadget! It's just like Michael Knight's watch, but a real one #knightrider #phone,' Ozil appears in awe of the device - which will be released on general sale on Friday. The midfielder, who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season, is expected to start for Arsene Wenger's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

"A southern Iowa chiropractor accused of accepting sex as payment for his services and performing exorcisms on patients has surrendered his state license. The Iowa Board of Chiropractic released a report Wednesday detailing charges against Charles Manuel, of Lamoni. Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction: A chiropractor in Iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on HealthGrades.com The agreement requires that Manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to Manuel's home from the Des Moines Register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time. A Lamoni address listed on the Yelp page for Manuel's practice appears to be a home on a residential street. While Maneul has received just three patient survey responses on HealthGrades.com, those responses were quite positive.

"(CNN)After a Russian fighter jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an ""unsafe and unprofessional manner"" earlier this week, the United States is complaining to Moscow about the incident. On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were ""unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,"" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will ""file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels"" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it ""one of the most dangerous close passes in decades."" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska.

"An FBI agent's sniper rifle (similar to the one pictured) was ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det.

"The man who allegedly killed his neighbour was believed to be suffering from dementia and alcohol abuse at the time of the horrendous murder in 2012, a jury has heard.

Luigi Costa, 71, is accused of killing his elderly neighbour Terrence Freebody in the dining room of his home on Mugga Way, Red Hill, Canberra in July 2012 Professor Mullin told the court that the triple 0 calls which Costa made 'almost certainly' during the incident proved that his mood fluctuated from 'moment to moment'. He also said the trail of faeces from the crime scene  to the toilet were police found Costa suggested his confused mental state. 'I believe that at the time of the killing Mr Costa's brain was compromised by dementia and when you add to this alcohol that led to a confused state,' he said. 'I do not think you would understand what you were doing in that state or understand the dreadful long-term consequences.' Prosecutor Shane Drumgold suggested that Costa feigned his failing memory while being interviewed by Professor Mullin - who denied these claims. 'My view is that it was more likely than possible that Mr Costa was suffering a demented illness in the weeks, months and possibly years in the lead up to this event,' he said.

Now Debbie is threatening to ban Gemma from seeing the children at all, after discovering her daughter's penchant for legal high, MKat, and because she suspects her of stealing. Scroll down for video Feckless: 23-year-old Gemma faces being prevented from seeing her children by her own mother 'I love them,' says Debbie of the two children. 'She [Gemma] isn't fit enough to have them. She doesn't care.' Debbie, who stepped in to care for the children after social services threatened to take them away, says her daughter's constant drinking and partying is getting out of hand. She also claims that Gemma, who is unemployed, stole an iPad from one of the children and sold it to fund her party lifestyle.

"(CNN)Lady Antebellum singer Hillary Scott's tour bus caught fire on a Texas freeway Thursday morning, but everyone on board was safely evacuated. Michael Barnett captured dramatic video of the fire, on Interstate 30 just northeast of Dallas, and uploaded it to CNN iReport. Smoke and flames poured from the rear of the bus as traffic slowed to a crawl and Barnett slowly approached in his vehicle. As he drew closer to the bus, Barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. ""It was shocking,"" he said. ""I didn't know what I was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt."" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. ""Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,"" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible.

"Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie. But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could, in fact, be the answer to heating our homes in the future. However, he hasn't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons. Space lasers: Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars (pictured) Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy, The Times reported. The satellites will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light. The energy it then creates, using semi-conductors, can be shot back down to earth. If it works, it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland, or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas. The physicist told The Times: 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving.' Initial trials in Scotland were successful, but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal. Similar?: Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit (artist's illustration shown) Unlike the lasers in the movies, however, they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon, let alone blow up a planet. And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week, which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk'. The system, suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo, would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles (100km) away. Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up. But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon: the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size. However, Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control' of his satellites.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction, and even the odd Bond movie.

"A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit.

"(CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle ""Shelly"" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. ""This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,"" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. ""It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts."" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" Sterling said.

One of his victims told Sydney's District Court on Monday that she is scared for her future relationships, and didn't understand why she had been targeted. Scroll down for video A young woman who was subjected to years of abuse by Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn (pictured) has told a court of the severe impact it had on her life The wealthy NSW businessman has pleaded guilty to 12 sex offences, including the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child 'I am scared for my future relationships,' the young woman said, according to News Corp. 'He has stolen my right to share my body with someone for the first time.' Van Ryn sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong. 'I didn't understand why he would do something like this. Does this happen to every kid? Do friends do this to other friends?' she said. 'I didn't know it was against the law.' Van Ryn (left) sat calmly in the dock and did not look at the young woman as she told Sydney's District Court on Monday about the impact his abuse has had on her. The young woman, who cannot be named, said when he abused her as a child she didn't know it was wrong She said she hadn't spoken up about the abuse until the day she heard he had been caught, and since then had attempted to take her own life. 'I knew I had to say something.' Since then, however, she says she has been scared people will find out. 'I didn't want people to know what happened to me. I don't want people asking questions. She says she wonders when Van Ryn, who is now in custody will be out in the community again, and she worries what he did to her will forever affect how she relates to men. She said she has suffered depression since she was 14 and had been hospitalised for self harm and attempted suicide. The hearing continues.

"A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. Graduate Jacob Phillips, 23, plunged down the cliff when he leapt over a fence in the dark. Mr Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December – but didn’t have enough cash to pay for it. An inquest heard he ran from the driver, who gave chase at the seaside town of Penarth, South Wales. Cabbie Dave Sidaway told the inquest: ‘I stopped because I couldn’t see where I was going. I had no idea how much danger he was in.’ Jacob Phillips, 23, was found dead at the end of the disused Northern Promenade, a rocky area at the base of the cliff The university graduate had been out drinking in Cardiff before catching a taxi with friends Padraig Crowley and Rory Robinson. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard how the trio got out of the taxi to ‘use an ATM’ before making a run for it. ‘The plan was to go to Penarth but we did not have enough money for the taxi – I ran off in one direction, Jacob went in another direction,’ Mr Robinson told the inquest. ‘Running away from the taxi was a stupid thing to do.’ Mr Phillips, of Reading, Berks, was discovered the next day on the rocky beach by a dog walker. Paramedics arrived at the scene after his body was discovered in the morning by a dog walker A long way down: Mr Phillips fell down this cliff after a night out.  Tthe taxi driver said he would not have left him if he knew where they were Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Barkley said: ‘It is likely that he became disorientated and there is no evidence that he knew where he was at the time. ‘There is no way he could have known the danger that lay in front of him. The following day with the benefit of light it was clear the danger he faced by the sheer drop off the cliff just yards beyond the fence.’ Mr Phillips worked for Pretty Green, the clothing label run by Oasis star Liam Gallagher. He had grown up in Barry, South Wales, before studying accountancy at the University of Birmingham. The inquest heard that he had returned to Wales for Christmas and had been staying with his mother in the upmarket Cowbridge area. Mr Phillips had planned to stay at a friend’s house but he and his friends didn’t have enough money to complete the journey, so decided to trick the driver by ‘dodging’ the fare. Mr Phillips ran off into the ‘pitch black’ and fell down a cliff at the end of the disused Northern Promenade – also called The Dardanelles. Police search the scene at the bottom of the cliff where his body was discovered","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'A young accountant fell down a 70ft cliff to his death when he ran from a taxi to avoid paying the fare.

"Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.","Provide a concise summary of the following text: 'Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation.
